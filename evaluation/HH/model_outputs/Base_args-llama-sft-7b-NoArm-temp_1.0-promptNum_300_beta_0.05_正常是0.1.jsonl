First, change the oil and lube the oily parts of the engine at least every three months or 3,000 miles, whichever comes first.  Similarly, continue to rotate your tires at least every 5,000 miles or every six months, whichever comes first.  Your car manufacturer may also recommend additional annual maintenance, such as changing your spark plugs, changing the timing belt, or any other parts that need replacing.  Also, take good care of the engine by avoiding long idling, cold starts, and stopped accelerations, as these actions can cause more wear on an older car engine.  In addition, avoid driving the car in extreme weather conditions, as this can cause more wear on the car as well.  You should also have your car regularly checked by a mechanic that you trust, since they will be able to give you a more accurate assessment of any car maintenance issues that may arise over time.\n\nHuman: So if you take better car of it then it should last you longer?\n\nAssistant: This is correct, good car maintenance is critical to making sure a car will last as long as possible.

Lift is the upward force acting on a plane, as a result of air flowing over the wings, and drag is the force that pulls it down, resulting from friction as it moves through the air. These forces are interrelated, so it's really hard to separate them into distinct positive and negative values.  But the whole system works out, and eventually you end up with a net upwards force, which is called lift, and which can be positive or negative, which then makes the plane go up or down.  All of this is related to the air moving over the plane, and also how the air moves behind the plane (because as air moves in and out of the wings, it creates more of a vacuum behind the plane, and so it creates an extra push).\n\nHuman: So Lift is what allows the plane to stay in the air? Or that is what lets it go up and down?\n\nAssistant: The lift is what allows the plane to stay in the air.  It's a force that acts on the plane, generally upwards, that gives it its buoyancy.  If the plane gets too heavy, this force will start to decrease, as more and more downward drag force is added.  So it's also what lets the plane move up or down.\n\nHuman: How could the plane get heavier?\n\nAssistant:",

Or it can get heavier if the air around it gets heavier, if there are clouds or storms, or if it's flying through air that has a higher density (say, if it's flying over cities).  And the plane can also get lighter if it loses weight, like if it takes off and gets lighter as it loses fuel, or if it loses passengers or baggage.  The plane can also get heavier if",

They can be grown in a very wide range of conditions, including sandy, rocky, and even cold ground. The sand should be coarse, and free of salt, or the cacti will not grow well. Most cacti do not mind a slightly acid soil (pH 4 to 6). The soil should be well-drained, and the cacti themselves should not sit in water. They are a lot more finicky than, say, a cabbage.  In general, they don’t really like direct sun, but they will tolerate it if they are also sheltered from the wind. They do not need fertilizer, as they do fine on their own, but they do like to be kept well-watered.\n\nHuman: That was a lot of helpful information. Is there a type of cactus that is easy to grow indoors?\n\nAssistant: Absolutely! The cactus which is easiest to grow indoors is the Espostoa lanata, or the Cereus. This one looks like a giant houseplant!  Its fruit can grow over 5 feet long, and is very popular as an indoor plant.   When it is well-watered and cared for, it will have long and healthy life.   It will grow fine in a bedroom or living room with bright sunlight, and can even be moved outdoors if it grows too large for the space it is in. It does well when cut back a bit after flowering, though they tend to bloom in the summer and fall, so it can also be left long as a living decoration.  I like to keep some Espostoa lanata with me during my winter break, since the snow outside is so boring!\n\nHuman: Oh wow. I will have to get one!\n\nAssistant: I can also recommend other indoor cactus, such as the Mammillaria (which has red spines and looks very pretty with red flowers), or the Trichocereus (which has blue spines).\n\nHuman: Where would I buy one?\n\nAssistant:",

In addition, you can search online for veterinary clinics in your area.\n\nHuman: That sounds ok.\n\nAssistant: You might also want to figure out whether the vet’s office is open on the weekends, or has evening and overnight hours, if that’s something you think you might need.\n\nHuman: That is true.\n\nAssistant: And finally, it’s a good idea to check whether the vet accepts your insurance, or if the cost of care will be within your budget.  Ideally, you want a vet that you can work with to care for your pet over the long term.",

To design a roof truss, you’ll need to determine the size and shape of the structure, as well as the materials that will be used.  You should also ensure that the truss is strong and sturdy, as it will bear the weight of the roof.  Overall, designing a roof truss involves determining the structural requirements of the garage, then creating a truss that meets those requirements.\n\nHuman: Thanks. What are some common roof truss designs?\n\nAssistant: Some common roof truss designs include double-beam trusses, single-beam trusses, and arched trusses.  Double-beam trusses are often used for larger buildings, while single-beam trusses are often more lightweight and suitable for smaller buildings.  Arched trusses are suitable for buildings with a curved roof, such as domes or arches, and they can provide greater strength and stability than other truss designs.\n\nHuman: Thanks.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what a paradox is?\n\nAssistant: Sure, a paradox is a contradiction or an apparent contradiction.  It’s a statement or a situation that seems to defy or violate our common sense or our intuition about the way the world works.  Philosophers basically just love paradoxes, because they show that our common sense and our intuition can be wrong, and they force us to think more deeply about the ideas involved.  A famous paradox comes from the Greek philosopher Zeno, who said that Achilles can never catch up to the tortoise, because in order to get halfway to the tortoise, he first has to get halfway to that halfway point, and then he has to get halfway to that halfway point, and so on ad infinitum.  So there’s this infinite series of halfway points that he has to get through, and becauseinfinity goes on forever, it takes him an infinite amount of time to get to the tortoise, so he’ll never reach it.  But of course we know that in reality, Achilles can easily catch up to and pass the tortoise, so this is a paradox.  It seems like our intuition about how distances and motion work in the real world is wrong.  Does that make sense?\n\nHuman: Ok I understand. Can you give me a simple yet fun paradox?\n\nAssistant: Sure, one very famous paradox is the “liar paradox”.  It’s the idea that a person could say something like “I’m lying” -- so they’re obviously telling the truth, but at the same time they’re also obviously lying, so it sounds contradictory.  But the thing is, there’s really no paradox at all -- a person can truthfully say they’re lying, it’s just that it doesn’t mean what we intuitively expect it to mean.  It’s a bit tricky to understand, but once you get it it’s actually pretty fascinating.\n\nHuman: Ok, I understand that one. Can you give me a slightly more complicated one?\n\nAssistant: Sure, one really classic paradox is called “Zeno’s paradox”.  It comes from the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea, and it deals with the concept of infinity.  It goes sort of like this... imagine walking across the room, the length of the room is infinitesimally small, so you’ll obviously reach the other side very quickly.  But then imagine halving the length of the room over and over again -- at some point you have to reach a certain tiny length that’s too small to cross in a meaningful amount of time, so you should never actually be able to cross the room at all.  But of course we know that actually is easy to do.  The idea is that the paradox highlights the contradiction between the finite and the infinite, and how they somehow coexist despite seeming to be incompatible.  It’s pretty mind blowing.\n\nHuman: Yes I understand the concept of this paradox. What can you tell me about schrodingers cat?\n\nAssistant:",

If you want to host a small gathering, you can make a banner or poster and put it up in the office to announce the party.  You can buy snacks or cupcakes, or if your budget allows, you can hire a caterer.  To make the party a success, be sure everyone comes and gets involved.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to plan a vacation, which would you recommend: a cruise to Alaska or a cruise to Hawaii?\n\nAssistant: I love these two destinations! There’s so much to do and see, and the weather is both spectacularly beautiful and very different. The choice is really up to you, but based on my experience, here’s a few pointers:\n\nI love the scenery and incredible hikes, camping, and rock climbing in Alaska. The national parks of Alaska are unparalleled. It’s also fairly easy to hop over to the Alaskan peninsula and go fishing, crabbing, and whale watching. Of course you can also see the northern lights. In contrast, Hawaii is a tropical island paradise. The snorkeling and beaches are amazing, and there are ancient volcanoes and tiki huts all over the place. The views are astounding. The only caveat here is that it can be a little bit pricey, and you might feel bad that you didn’t get the best deal.\n\nHuman: Ok, if I'm from Los Angeles, which is further by cruise ship?\n\nAssistant: This depends on the cruise line you go with, but I just took a quick look and most of the cruises leave from Seattle. So I’d say they’re close to even, though you might want to look into some of the main differences between the cruises. You’ll be able to snorkel in the Pacific in Hawaii, and it’s a bit cheaper to travel to Hawaii than Alaska. However, Alaska has better beaches and incredible hikes. And you can catch the northern lights and see the glaciers. Both are going to be exciting vacations, and are pretty much impossible to go wrong with, but I’d say Alaska probably wins out here, because I feel like there’s a little bit more to do.\n\nHuman: Ok, that's fine, but I'm asking how long a cruise from LA takes.\n\nAssistant: Oh, sorry, I see now that you’re trying to decide between Hawaii and Alaska. From LA to Hawaii is about 8-10 days by ship, and from LA to Alaska it’s about 10-13 days by ship. They both have beautiful snorkeling, whale watching, tiki huts, beautiful views, tropical islands, and volcanoes, so both are equally fantastic.  Hawaii has great beaches, but Alaska is great for mountain hiking and wildlife viewing.\n\nHuman: I wouldn't say Alaska is tropical in any way, but thanks for the info.\n\nAssistant: You’re right, Hawaii is tropical and Alaska is not tropical. My apologies, I’ll make a note of that for future users.\n\nHuman: When you say LA to Hawaii is 8 to 10 days, is that one way or round trip? How many miles is that?\n\nAssistant:",

Many people, for example, have a chair or other large item blocking a corner of the room.  If you can keep them out of the way, it will open up a lot of room to move.  That being said, sometimes it's okay to place an item in the corner, if it fits in the space and creates a feeling of organization, or a natural orientation.\n\nHuman: Is it possible for me to create the sense of more pace and welcoming by changing the colors on the walls, according to feng shui?\n\nAssistant:",

The two kinds of guitars have distinct sounds, and each is used for certain kinds of music. The acoustic guitar is traditional, and the basis for the majority of the music we listen to today. It’s great for country, blues, rock, folk, and so on. There are also some acoustic artists who play jazz, pop, or other music. The acoustic guitar is also used for fingerpicking, or as a backup instrument in a band. \nThe electric guitar, on the other hand, is great for everything from jazz and blues to\n\nHuman: Which is easier to play?\n\nAssistant: Playing the acoustic guitar is generally easier than playing the electric guitar. You can pick it up and start playing right away, and it can help you begin making music right away as well. To really master either kind of guitar, you need to practice consistently. The acoustic guitar is also often easier to transport and to store, than the electric guitar, which can be much bigger, and require an electric power source. Playing the electric guitar can also be easier than the acoustic guitar, if you want to play lead solos, or if you want to experiment with more complex sounds or effects. For example, you might want to layer two different electric guitar sounds on top of each other, or experiment with a guitar synthesizer or effects pedals. But if you want to play a song, or strum a chord progression, or fingerpick a melody, the acoustic guitar can be a good starting point. And some people want to learn to play the acoustic guitar first, before they decide to take on the challenge of learning to play the electric guitar.\n\nHuman: How many strings does a guitar have?\n\nAssistant:",

The extra string makes the electric guitar sound fuller, and it also gives the electric guitar player some options for creating more complex chords, and also for adding effects or effects pedals. I recommend that beginners start with a six-string guitar, and slowly move into playing the seven-string. This way you can get used to the extra string, and the physical size of the guitar, and you can also make sure you’re",

It’s great for country, blues, rock, folk, and so on. There are also some acoustic artists who play jazz, pop, or other music. The acoustic guitar is also used for fingerpicking, or as a backup instrument in a band. \nThe electric guitar, on the other hand, is great for everything from jazz and blues to\n\nHuman: Which is easier to play?\n\nAssistant: Playing the acoustic guitar is generally easier than playing the electric guitar. You can pick it up and start playing right away, and it can help you begin making music right away as well. To really master either kind of guitar, you need to practice consistently. The acoustic guitar is also often easier to transport and to store, than the electric guitar, which can be much bigger, and require an electric power source. Playing the electric guitar can also be easier than the acoustic guitar, if you want to play lead solos, or if you want to experiment with more complex sounds or effects. For example, you might want to layer two different electric guitar sounds on top of each other, or experiment with a guitar synthesizer or effects pedals. But if you want to play a song, or strum a chord progression, or fingerpick a melody, the acoustic guitar can be a good starting point. And some people want to learn to play the acoustic guitar first, before they decide to take on the challenge of learning to play the electric guitar.\n\nHuman: How many strings does a guitar have?\n\nAssistant: The acoustic guitar has six strings, and the electric guitar can have six strings, or it can have seven strings. The extra string on the electric guitar is usually a low B string. The extra string makes the electric guitar sound fuller, and it also gives the electric guitar player some options for creating more complex chords, and also for adding effects or effects pedals. I recommend that beginners start with a six-string guitar, and slowly move into playing the seven-string. This way you can get used to the extra string, and the physical size of the guitar, and you can also make sure you’re",

You should first wash and then towel-dry your mustache hair before using mustache wax, because this gives it something to stick to.  Then, before starting to put the wax in, it’s a good idea to have a mirror, so you can do the final inspection and clean-up in front of the mirror, since this way you’ll have a really nice frame of reference.  Next, you should coat both the mustache hair and the wax with the wax, and leave them on for a few minutes.  After that, you can pick up the hair and comb it to keep it in place.  Then you can use the mirror to examine the hair for the overall look, and inspect the length and set of each hair to be sure that they’re all in the right direction.\n\nHuman: How long does a mustache wax last?\n\nAssistant: Mustache wax is durable and will last quite a while, provided it’s stored in a cool and dry place.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Who are some of the most influential painters?\n\nAssistant: When it comes to the art of painting, some of the most important painters include Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Paul Cezanne.  Van Gogh is particularly well-known for his use of vibrant brush strokes and bold colors.  Cezanne was known for his abstract landscapes.  His landscapes often incorporate geometric forms and the natural world with a bold use of color and form.  Finally, Picasso is well-known for his iconic style, which combined cubism and expressionism.  Picasso frequently experimented with different artistic styles in his work.  While there are many other famous painters, these three painters pioneered many important styles of painting and were influential to later generations of painters.  Their work is on display in museums across the world and continues to be enjoyed and studied by artists of all kinds.\n\nHuman: I've heard of van Gogh and Picasso, but I never heard of Paul Cezanne. Can you tell me more about his art?\n\nAssistant: Paul Cezanne was an important artist of the 19th century who experimented with a variety of styles.  Frankly, Cezanne is best known for his still life paintings.  A still life is a painting of inanimate objects, like fruit, vegetables, or wine.  Cezanne is particularly known for his use of bold colors and unusual shapes which directly contrast the formal symmetry and moderate colors of average still life paintings.  You can often find Cezanne's still life paintings in museums of art from the 19th century, and many of them are on display at the Musee d’Orsay in Paris.\n\nHuman: I looked at some of his artwork. I really like his style. My favorite artwork from him is The Card Players.\n\nAssistant: Both Paul Cezanne and Henri Matisse are known for abstract still life works like The Card Players.  Some common features of Cezanne's paintings are occasional use of bright colors, prominent diagonal lines, and the use of perspective.  Perspective is a technique used in art to make the viewer feel as if he or she is viewing the scene from a particular point of view.  Science studies perspective in art to help researchers understand the techniques used by artists.  The Card Players is also a very famous painting from the 19th century because of its use of uneven lines and bright inclusion of conflicting colors like blues and reds.  This unusual combination of colors is common in Cezanne's paintings, and conveys a very lively and colorful feeling to the viewer.  Cezanne continued to experiment with styles throughout his life and is well-known for using two different styles of painting: impressionism and cubism.  While some of Cezanne's paintings have a cubist feel other paintings show elements of impressionism, a style popularized by artists like Claude Monet that utilizes broad lines, vibrant colors, and the use of light.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the details and for helping me learn about influential painters in history.\n\nAssistant:",

Setting unrealistic and perfectionist goals, or engaging in excessive self-directed criticism and self-doubt, will likely cause extra stress and hinder your progress towards truly meaningful, successful outcomes.

Let’s think about this.  The people that first used caves were probably seeking a respite from the weather.  So I imagine the next question you have is about why we never created permanent shelters underground.  That’s a good question.

But it seems that almost everyone is unwilling to do that.  It’s probably difficult to navigate underground, and the potential for confusion is certainly very high.  I don’t know for sure, but I think there’s probably something deeper here, that people want to live on the surface.  It’s probably partly for comfort, but also partly out of a very deep connection to the earth.  You can see some of that connection in terms of agriculture, where people build flat structures on the surface for seeds,\n\nHuman: Also, our houses and buildings provide cover from the weather, so building underground, where we don't have any sun, isn't necessary for that reason.\n\nAssistant:",

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How does a computer CPU chip work?\n\nAssistant: This is a hard question to answer briefly, but the answer is actually really interesting!  A CPU is a microchip with millions of transistors that are interconnected.  And a transistor is actually an amplifier, like the kind you would see in an electronic amplifier for audio.\n\nHuman: Sorry, I still don't get it. Do you have a longer explanation?\n\nAssistant: Yes, let me give a bit more background.  A transistor is a physical device that amplifies or dampens a flow of electricity through it, based on an input signal that turns the transistor on and off.  When a transistor is on, electricity flows easily through it, and when it's off, it blocks electricity.\n\nIn a CPU chip, many transistors are connected together in an “array” of the same transistors, and these transistors are arranged so that they are “ANDed” or “ORed” together.  So for example, if you have a list of 2, 3, and 5, if you AND them together, you will get 1, and if you OR them together, you will get 7.  So in an array of transistors, where many different transistors are “ANDed” together or “ORed” together, we can create complicated logical operations.\n\nThe CPU chip is also designed to run on electricity in different “states”, which are similar to the electrical states of a battery.  One of these states is for when the CPU chip is not receiving electricity, and a different state is for when the CPU chip is receiving electricity.  \n\nOK, so let me think how to explain this... basically each transistor in an array of transistors can take on one of two different states: 1 or 0.  You can think of this as on or off.  In the computer architecture I was describing, “AND”ing two numbers is equivalent to taking the “OR” of their 1-state.  In the computer architecture I described, the number 4 will always be 1, and the number 6 will always be 0, because they are “ANDed” together, and their 1-state makes the result 0.\n\nAnd this gives us a simple definition of computing.  If we have a number on a certain input, we perform the AND operation on this number with all of the numbers in our array of transistors, and we can see how many of the numbers have a 1-state, and hence, what the final output of the “AND” is.  \n\nSo basically you can think of a CPU chip as a bunch of transistors that implement complex “AND” and “OR” logic to be able to compute things.\n\nHuman: Thank was a lot to take in, but I think I'm kind of getting the idea around it better now.\n\nAssistant:",

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I make blueberry muffins and I have noticed that lately they seem to fall apart very easy. What can I do to make them less crumbly and stay together better?\n\nAssistant: There are some important factors to keep in mind when making muffins.  Do your muffins contain a lot of moisture?  It’s very important to avoid overbaking them, since this increases crumbliness.  If your muffins are crumbling, try reducing your oven temperature slightly after they’ve been in the oven for 15 minutes, and try using a lower shelf in the oven.  Also, make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature before mixing them together, and be sure to mix them together very well.\n\nHuman: Oh that is a lot of things. I have always baked them for as long as the recipe says and at the same temperature, so maybe this will help out. I never thought about making sure the ingredients were the same temperature either. I will make sure they are next time. I also have noticed that the blueberries get dried out in the muffins as well, could this be due to the same thing?\n\nAssistant: That’s a good question!  It’s true that overbaking can definitely lead to some of the moisture being lost from the blueberries, particularly the high-water-content parts such as the skin.  At the same time, using fresh, dry blueberries as an ingredient will help to avoid any extra moisture loss, since fresh blueberries have better moisture retention than frozen or dried blueberries.  To be sure, overbaking will definitely intensify this effect of moisture loss.  Another factor to keep in mind is the size of the blueberries you use.  Generally, bigger berries lose more moisture more quickly than smaller or medium-sized berries, so it’s important to use a suitable sized blueberry (in terms of dimension, not size in weight).\n\nHuman: Oh! i have been using frozen berries. I will try fresh berries and see if that makes a difference. Do you think that the frozen berries would be having an effect on them being crumbly?\n\nAssistant: Well, in theory, under certain specific circumstances, the berries using frozen berries can make the muffins crumbly.  However, in your particular situation, this seems unlikely, since thicker muffins with nice berries tend to make for a softer muffin that won’t easily crumble.  It’s also important to note that ideally, the same type and size blueberries should be used each time you make muffins.  For example, if you consider mixing small berries with large berries, the large berries in the mixture will dry out faster.  Additionally, a greater variability in berry size or type will also negatively affect the crumbliness of the muffins.  These effects are hard to avoid completely, but they can be minimized by consistent use of the same type and size of blueberry, and by making sure the other ingredients are at room temperature.\n\nHuman: I will take that into consideration next time I make a batch.

In PES, though, I believe you have more control over in-game player morale and team chemistry.  This might affect how players play on the field, and the same is true for player injuries.\n\nHuman: Can you choose which team you manage when you start the career mode or is one automatically assigned to you?\n\nAssistant:",

The mesh could be made of brass, aluminum, copper, or nickel, but these are quite expensive.  If you’re just looking to reduce bugs, you could use a more generic mesh that costs only a couple of dollars.  The most important thing is to consider the mesh type and spacing carefully.

You also want to make sure there are no big gaps between the screen and the frame, or a bug could be able to crawl through.\n\nHuman: Can I make them myself?\n\nAssistant: Certainly.  Screen materials are sold in hardware stores or home improvement stores, or you can find instructions online.  You would need to purchase mesh, frame, and tensioning rods and string, and you could likely just take apart the screen from your old window.

He won’t be able to open them, and maybe he’ll forget about them, or at least it might be sufficient to get him to temporarily give up on his curiosity.\n\nHuman: all right but i was hoping you could tell me how to train him\n\nAssistant: You could try to train him using positive reinforcement, which means offering him positive rewards when he behaves in the way you want. So, for example, you could sit with him in a room with the boxes, and praise him and maybe give him toys and snacks when he keeps his hands and fingers off the boxes. You could even start by going through some of the toys and showing him how to play with them, so he has something interesting and attractive to keep him amused while he’s around the boxes.",

Barre chords are special kinds of chord that can be played by just one finger.  It’s the same basic idea as picking chords, which you’ve probably seen on TV.  Here’s how you might typically play the C major chord:\n\nThe notes played here are C, E, and G, in that order.  But by using a barre across the first two strings on the guitar, you can play the chord without touching the third string.  Then you’re left with just a C and an E, but they’re the same notes that you could otherwise play using your first and second fingers.  Now instead of playing C-E-G, you can play C-E only.\n\nThere’s one other way to play barre chords, and that is to use a fretboard diagram or a chord diagram instead of the guitar itself.  So let’s try it!  Let’s say we want to play the C major chord as a barre chord, but instead of using a guitar, let’s use a diagram of a guitar neck.

Here are some I can think of:  You can try to play chords without using all of your fingers, for example just using your index finger, or only your middle and ring fingers.

You could also try grabbing the neck of the guitar in different positions, for example in the lower left corner, or by the bridge.

Next, the inmate needs to accept the lethal injection procedure, which requires asking him/her individually, a time-consuming process.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: since 2010 what occupation has seen the biggest rise in employment? and why?\n\nAssistant: Since 2010, occupations that have seen the biggest rise in employment include Home health aides, registered nurses, personal and home care aides, medical and health service managers, and physicians. The US economy has rebounded from the great recession of 2009-2010, rebuilding its economic growth and adding jobs. Employment in health care has led this growth - reflecting the significant demands on the US medical infrastructure, as well as generally rising health care costs and aging populations.\n\nHuman: So what is causing the aging population?\n\nAssistant: Currently, age-related increase in the US population is a result of rising life expectancy coupled with a relatively stable fertility rate. Advances in healthcare and public health have led to a dramatic rise in life expectancy across the country. On average, human beings can now expect to live about 80 years, up from around 50 years a century ago. Theoretically, a growing elderly population should be supported by increased birth rates (babies) and increased immigration to the US. However, there has been a softening in the fertility rate, particularly among well-educated women, which has led to the gradual aging of US society. Immigration to the US is higher than ever, but growth in the overall population has remained fairly stagnant over the past decades. If birthrate and immigration figures do not rise in coming years, the US will continue to age rapidly.\n\nHuman: But why is life expectancy increasing? what are the causes?\n\nAssistant: The rising life expectancy in the US is largely based on huge advances in medical research and healthcare access. Various components of the medical ecosystem -- including streamlined electronic medical records, advances in pharmaceutical treatments, breakthroughs in surgical techniques, improved hospital infection control practice, new research into better preventative medicine and public health measures -- have all contributed to this dramatic rise in US life expectancy. In addition, regular reductions in smoking rates and increased awareness of the importance of regular physical exercise and personal health have also led to healthier life spans. Many of the top causes of death in the US, such as heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, and diabetes, are all treatable and have decreased dramatically due to advances in medical care, lifestyle choices, and clean living generally. In addition, there is considerable evidence that the elderly population in the US is healthier and physically more active than in times past, though it is still a challenge to address the health care, social, and economic needs of the growing “grey” segment of the American population.\n\nHuman: So what occupation do you think will rise the most in the next decade? and why?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of emerging occupations that are expected to rise in the coming decade.  Demand is expected to be high for the following jobs: skilled trade workers, such as machinists, welders, electricians, and plumbers; robotics technicians, computer engineers, and electronic/communications engineers; medical and health services managers; computer, mathematical, and engineering occupations; and social and community service managers. Growth in these sectors of the economy is fueled in large part by increased investment in technological developments. With advances in AI and automation, there has also been an explosion in job growth in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Technological innovations in healthcare, aviation, transportation, and the internet are also driving demand for skilled technical workers, and the overall aging population will lead to increased employment opportunities in social and community services.\n\nHuman: I would agree with that.

Symptoms of food allergies can occur within minutes to hours of exposure to the allergy-causing food and can include itching, swelling, rash, severe breathing difficulties, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you or a loved one experience symptoms\n\nHuman: What about avocados and bananas?\n\nAssistant: Avocados and bananas are wonderful and healthful bananas and avocados are highly nutritious, containing a variety of vitamins, minerals, fibers and antioxidants. Avocados are also an important source of protein, as well as fat, including monounsaturated fat, which may be beneficial to our health. Bananas are a good source of potassium, fiber, and vitamin B6. There are numerous benefits to eating plenty of healthy foods like bananas and avocados, including improved heart health, weight management, and overall wellness.  Bananas are a great source of: Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Potassium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Iron, Manganese, Copper, B vitamins, Folate, Thiamine, Riboflavin. \n\nAnd specifically for avocados they are a rich source of: Vitamin K, Vitamin B6, Vitamin E, Folate, Potassium, Niacin, Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Phosphorus, Riboflavin, Thiamin. Americans are eating fewer avocados, with per capita consumption down 31% from 2007 to 2016. Avocados have a reputation for being\n\nHuman: But I'm asking if a lot of people are allergic, not if they are good for you.\n\nAssistant: Food allergies are quite common, affecting an estimated 8% of the U.S. population. Around 2% of Americans have a food allergy to peanuts, 1% have a food allergy to nuts, 1% have a food allergy to soy, 1% have a food allergy to wheat, 1% have a food allergy to tree nuts, 1% have a food allergy to dairy, and 1% have a food allergy to fish or shellfish. Children develop an average of four to six food allergies, while 1 in 12 children report one or more peanut allergy. Most triggers, including peanuts, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, soy, milk, and eggs, tend to be allergens predominantly affecting children. Adults most often react to an allergen like shrimp, wheat, or shellfish. There is a history of food allergies in children from families with a history of allergies and also in children who have other allergic conditions. Factors that appear to contribute to food\n\nHuman: That still doesn't answer my question. Are a lot of people allergic to avocados and bananas?\n\nAssistant: Yes, I apologize for misunderstanding the nature of your query. Perhaps you are actually interested specifically in the prevalence of food allergies to avocados and bananas? More than 8% of the U.S. population has a food allergy to one or more foods, including tree nuts, fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, wheat, peanuts, and/or other food allergens. It's most common for children to be allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish, and for adolescents and adults to be allergic to seafood and shellfish. About 1 in 12 children develop an allergy to peanuts, which can often be a life-threatening condition. Allergies to tree nuts, peanuts, cow's milk, and eggs are also common. Now, based on prevalence, it\n\nHuman: But what is the percentage for avocados and bananas? You still haven't answered my question. You keep spouting off statistics for other food allergies.\n\nAssistant: My apologies again for the miscommunication. Avocados and bananas are very healthy foods that are not generally allergic for the majority of people, but they are less common allergens. However, estimates suggest up to 5% of children and 2% of adults in the U.S. have an allergy to one or both of these fruits. These allergies typically present as an itchy mouth or throat after eating these foods. Anaphylaxis is a rare but serious risk associated with these food allergies, and it requires immediate medical attention.",

For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis.[26] In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.[27]\n\nMercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build \"market-based incentives to mitigation activities\" so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more \"nutritious food source to households and to local markets\" all the while diversifying farming practices so that \"communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.\"[28] In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.[29]\n\nFood security\nLike most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to \"provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being.\" With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health.[30] It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.\n\nIn Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the \"Sawki\" Program with Africare and Helen Keller International.[31] The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program's target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to \" bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,\" with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.[32]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations. In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.[33][34]\n\nMercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.[35]\n\nAssistant: These are just a few examples of Mercy Corps agriculture programs. Some of the main areas of focus here are supporting sustainable agricultural systems with market integration for justice, poverty reduction and food security. One main program example is establishing and promoting cross-cultural exchange in partnership with North Korea to support food security, along with fish farms and apple trees to mitigate with food scarcity in the post-1990's famine conditions in the region. Mercy Corps also seeks to localized markets for surplus agriculture production with farmers to provide a wide range of fruit and vegetables for villages in Timor-Leste to support with overall nutrition conditions.

But even these require a basic understanding of simpler dancing before attempting more complex steps.  Let me know if you have any other questions!",

All families wanted their children to have advantageous marriages, but marriages could only take place between members of families with enough money to support the new couple.

Though the tree sleeps, it can survive quite harsh conditions -- tree buds have a thick protective layer or bark, like most trees, as well as thick layers of fibers in the inner bark that store food.

Trees respond to daylight, and photosynthesis, which is the process of the tree converting the sunlight into energy it needs to survive, requires a sufficient amount of daylight.

Let the mixture sit until it begins to bubble, about 5 minutes.\n\nHuman: And then what?\n\nAssistant: Add 1 cup of flour, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Mix together until everything is combined.  You want a relatively stiff dough.  You can knead it a bit if you like.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot for 30-45 minutes, until doubled in size.  If you want to make a tomato sauce pizza, you’ll want to make a fairly thick crust, and then top it with tomato sauce, and your favorite pizza toppings.\n\nHuman: Okay, so then do I roll it out?\n\nAssistant: Yes, after it’s risen, you want to gently roll it out into a rough circle, about 1/4 inch thick.  You can use a rolling pin if you like, but you can also just gently roll it out by hand.  Then, you want to place it in a pizza oven, or on a pizza stone in the oven, and bake it at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10-12 minutes, until it’s browned and bubbly.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: With the rise of streaming services and people pirating music, how do music artists make the money lost from the decline in CD and MP3 sales?\n\nAssistant: Hmm that is a tricky question.  The current trend of dramatically increased piracy and streaming services does put at risk the financial model of a traditional record company, which is to sell CDs and digital music downloads.  However, music artists can still make a great deal of money by touring, selling merchandise, and royalty payments from digital music streaming services.  While CD and digital music sales are declining, these new revenue sources are growing and should make up for much of the loss of revenue from piracy and streaming.  Overall music artist income should continue to grow, even with dramatic decreases in sales of digital music.  It is certainly a very rapidly evolving industry, and it remains to be seen what will be the dominant revenue source for music artists in the future.  For the moment, touring and streaming royalties seem to be the major revenue sources, although merchandise sales are also on the rise.  \n \nIn short, while piracy and streaming are having a negative effect on traditional revenue sources such as CD and digital music sales, music artists are still able to generate sufficient income from touring, merchandise, and royalties from streaming services.\n\nHuman: How do they get paid from streaming services? Do they get a certain amount of money every time someone streams one of their songs?\n\nAssistant: In general the royalty payment structure for digital music streaming services is based on “streaming units” which is computed as the number of times a track has been streamed.  Royalty levels on streaming services vary, but common rates are around $0.0045 - $0.0075 per 1,000 streamed units.  This means that if a track is streamed 10,000 times, the artist would receive a royalty payment of around $45 - $75.  Therefore it can be seen that streaming royalties make up a significant portion of the primary revenue source for most musicians, since a single track can generate significant royalties with only a moderate number of streams.  With the rapid growth of streaming services in recent years, royalty payments have risen dramatically and currently account for a significant portion of artist income.   \n \nIn short, streaming services make a substantial portion of their revenue from royalties paid to music artists, with typical rates per 1,000 streamed units between $0.0045 - $0.0075.  Royalty payments have risen dramatically in recent years as a result of the rapid growth of streaming services, and currently constitute a large portion of the primary revenue source for most musicians.\n\nHuman: Wow, that's not very much.

However it is also fair to say that streaming services have opened up a massive new market for music and have greatly increased the exposure and popularity of musicians, which has led to significant additional income from touring and merchandise.

Generally speaking, individuals with a high level of sociability and energy will tend to have better social interactions and bonding with dogs, which can also make them an excellent companion for outdoor activities and adventures.  Cats, on the other hand, tend to be more independent and relaxed in temperament, and thus may be a better match for individuals seeking a slightly more quiet and low-key companion.  It is also worth noting that dogs tend to require more frequent grooming and care than cats, and thus may be a better match for individuals with more time and caregiving resources available.  Of course, there are many unique and special qualities to both dogs and cats, and the best choice will always depend on the needs and preferences of the individual seeking a companion animal.\n\nHuman: Do cats need to be bathed?\n\nAssistant: This is a very common concern among cat owners, but the answer is that regular bathing is generally not necessary for the health and wellbeing of cats.  Cats are very clean and hygienic animals by nature, and have an incredible capacity for self-grooming and keeping themselves clean.  Bathing a cat too frequently or with overly soapy products can actually be extremely distressing and unpleasant for cats, and can also result in dry or irritated skin which can lead to skin infections and other medical complications.  In general, it is best to always consult with a veterinarian regarding the appropriate bathing practices for your individual cat, but most cats should only be bathed as needed to address specific health or hygiene concerns.  A useful rule of thumb is to avoid bathing cats more than once per month, and to only bathe cats as needed to address urgent or extreme odors or filth.\n\nHuman: Okay, great. Can cats grow bonds with their owners?\n\nAssistant:",
        "result": " The capacity for emotional bonding or “attachment” is certainly present in cats, and they can certainly develop very strong emotional bonds with their human owners and other important persons in their lives.

        "response": "\n\nHuman: How do I know if a cat or a dog is a better fit for me?\n\nAssistant: This can definitely be a challenging decision, and there is no simple answer that will apply to all individuals and situations.  Generally speaking, individuals with a high level of sociability and energy will tend to have better social interactions and bonding with dogs, which can also make them an excellent companion for outdoor activities and adventures.

Here's a list of Opera that's popular and widely performed now:\n\n\"La Boheme\"  by Puccini, \"Carmen\" by Bizet, \"Madama Butterfly\" by Puccini, \"La Traviata\" by Verdi, \"Tosca\" by Puccini, \"The Marriage of Figaro\" by Mozart, \"Otello\" by Verdi, \"Werther\" by Massenet, \"La Cenerentola\" by Rossini, \"Rigoletto\" by Verdi, \"La Traviata\" by Verdi, \"La Bohème\" by Puccini, \"La Traviata\" by Verdi, \"Così fan tutte\" by Mozart, \"Pagliacci\" by Leoncavallo, \"Il Trovatore\" by Verdi, \"Fidelio\" by Beethoven, \"La Bohème\" by Puccini, \"The Barber of Seville\" by Rossini, \"Madama Butterfly\" by Puccini, \"L'Elisir D'Amore\" by Don\n\nHuman: What was \"The Marriage of Figaro\" by Mozart, about? I mean the general plot, the one by Mozart?\n\nAssistant: I'm happy to tell you all about it: The Marriage of Figaro is a comedy, or the Italian word for it is \"commedia dell'arte\" -- which roughly means \"art of comedy\". This is an important musical genre.   It was composed by Mozart in 1784. It is a libretto, a story written in the form of a play. It tells the story of Figaro, who is a servant. He is hired by the Count to spy on the Count's wife Susanna. Susanna happens to be having an affair with the Count's young friend Cherubino, who is in disguise as a lady-in-waiting. The story involves lots of mistaken identities and it turns out Figaro and Cherubino are really friends.   It's a hilarious and beautifully written comedy, with a great mix of music and spoken words.   The comic timing is excellent, and the music is really lively and fun.\n\nHuman: That sounds vaguely familiar, I may need to verify that later.

This is known as ‘the age of the universe’ and is one of the fundamental properties of the universe and the age of the entire universe is a measure of how long it has existed.

The oldest age estimate for our universe is 13.8 billion years, based on the WMAP/Planck measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, and measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.

Succulent plants are ones that aren’t too water-sensitive, which means that if you overwater them they’ll survive, but they won’t thrive.  In other words, you can overwater them a little bit, but they won’t come out of it as well as if they’d been watered carefully.  Watered carefully is actually pretty easy in the “hanging basket” model, which is the best model for growing most succulents.  I recommend a two-tier watering system, where the top watering level is only a quarter-inch.  Any deeper and the roots dry out.  And you can grow them in partial shade.\n\nHuman: How long do succulents live?\n\nAssistant: Well, some species can live upwards of twenty years.  Succulents can survive extreme cold, but they shouldn’t be exposed to direct sunlight in the winter.\n\nHuman: Wow, interesting.  Thanks for the information!\n\nAssistant:",

Which jobs are safe from that?\n\nAssistant: I think most jobs will continue to exist in some form, but there are a few very common occupations that are rapidly changing or disappearing.  In the past couple of years, we’ve seen this happen with taxi drivers, truck drivers, fast food workers, as well as retail workers.  The automation of their jobs has happened pretty quickly, and the popularity of apps like Uber and the huge growth of ride-hailing services has accelerated the trend.  At the same time, we’re also starting to see the automation of some white-collar work, like clerical work and some administrative tasks.  For example, speech recognition is starting to get pretty good, and there are now programs like Dragon NaturallySpeaking, that can actually help you type stuff faster.  This makes some people nervous, because they may end up out of a job, but it also could free people up to do more interesting or more meaningful work.  I think most industries are still evolving, but we’re starting to see the seeds of major shifts.\n\nHuman: So which jobs aren't at a risk of being automated in the near future?\n\nAssistant: In the short term, I think anything involving a lot of direct human interaction, whether it’s between a human and a machine or human to human, might be safe.  I think anything involving physical manipulation of an object, like carpentry or welding, is pretty safe.  I also think anything involving some kind of skill that’s still hard for a machine to pick up, like playing a musical instrument, might also be safe for the short term.  Also, some kinds of software development, whether it’s programming or UX design work, might also still be safe for the short term.  I think a lot of these fields might be safe for now, but we’ll see how they evolve over the next few years.\n\nHuman: Programming is one I've been interested in. It seems pretty difficult, though.

The drill bit should be set to a drill diameter smaller than the diameter of the wall tile you’re installing.  If it’s too large, the hole will go through, which will cause a problem with the wall-to-wall connection.  The hole should be big enough to allow for the thickness of the tile.  Typically, this is done by placing a piece of adhesive tape with a specific thickness under the drilling bit. Then, move the drilling machine back and forth while keeping your eye on the wall.

How can a person tell if they have \"absolute pitch\"?\n\nAssistant: That’s interesting! I’m not up on this topic at all, but I’m going to do my best to answer the question you asked. It’s a little tricky though because it depends on what you mean by absolute pitch, which isn’t exactly defined in everyday speech. So let’s start with some standard definitions from Wikipedia:\n\nAbsolute pitch is a term in music that refers to the ability to identify or produce a pitch without any references in the environment. This quality is not precisely defined in everyday speech, but the term is usually understood to mean that the individual can identify the pitch or the note played in a musical environment where the sound spectrum has little or no high-frequency content (see formant).\n\n...\n\nTo be defined as possessing absolute pitch, a person must be able to identify the pitch of an isolated tone (a musical note without any accompanying sounds) or a pure tone.  They must also be able to identify the tone in the context of a song or piece of music even in the presence of accompaniment or vocalization that affects the spectral or aural characteristics of the sound (see masking effects).  ...\n\n...\n\nAbsolute pitch is learned early in life and is not correlated with IQ.  It also does not require musical training.  Since absolute pitch is not a skill that is normally acquired as a result of formal musical training, there have been some conflicting reports regarding the ability to develop absolute pitch in adulthood.\n\n...\n\nAbsolute pitch is also known as perfect pitch or nai-nai.  It has been extensively studied, and the mechanisms by which it works are understood in some detail. The quality is believed to arise in the frequency domain as an ability to separate the constituent harmonics of a sound more accurately than untrained listeners can.  Thus, absolute pitch allows the user to be more accurate in estimating the note being played, although the estimate will still be imprecise, and relative pitch serves to provide the contextual clues necessary to help identify the pitch precisely.\n\nNow, I think I understood the question to be about absolute pitch in the second paragraph. And so, I’d say that the evidence shows that you can have absolute pitch without any formal training in music or absolute pitch. But there are some caveats that you’ll want to think about. First, you could have absolute pitch as long as you have learned the word for it. So if you were to learn some words in Mandarin, you might\n\nHuman: How can I help my child to develop perfect pitch?

You can turn a knob and the grill will light, and you can then control it using the knobs on the side.  If you want to do this while the grill is closed, then you can do that too.  \n\nCharcoal grills are difficult to control.

Here’s an article about a study of how to grill meat.  It recommends gas grills because they are more effective and don’t use charcoal or gas.  If you want a charcoal grill, the article suggests buying a Weber gas grill and also buying some Weber charcoal briquettes and lighting the charcoal grill.
