            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can you keep your older car on the road longer?\n\nAssistant: There are a few key car maintenance items that are critical to making sure a car is safe.  First, change the oil and lube the oily parts of the engine at least every three months or 3,000 miles, whichever comes first.  Similarly, continue to rotate your tires at least every 5,000 miles or every six months, whichever comes first.  Your car manufacturer may also recommend additional annual maintenance, such as changing your spark plugs, changing the timing belt, or any other parts that need replacing.  Also, take good care of the engine by avoiding long idling, cold starts, and stopped accelerations, as these actions can cause more wear on an older car engine.  In addition, avoid driving the car in extreme weather conditions, as this can cause more wear on the car as well.  You should also have your car regularly checked by a mechanic that you trust, since they will be able to give you a more accurate assessment of any car maintenance issues that may arise over time.\n\nHuman: So if you take better car of it then it should last you longer?\n\nAssistant: This is correct, good car maintenance is critical to making sure a car will last as long as possible.  By practicing proper car care, a car can keep running safely for hundreds of thousands of miles.

Lift is the upward force acting on a plane, as a result of air flowing over the wings, and drag is the force that pulls it down, resulting from friction as it moves through the air. These forces are interrelated, so it's really hard to separate them into distinct positive and negative values.  But the whole system works out, and eventually you end up with a net upwards force, which is called lift, and which can be positive or negative, which then makes the plane go up or down.  All of this is related to the air moving over the plane, and also how the air moves behind the plane (because as air moves in and out of the wings, it creates more of a vacuum behind the plane, and so it creates an extra push).\n\nHuman: So Lift is what allows the plane to stay in the air? Or that is what lets it go up and down?\n\nAssistant: The lift is what allows the plane to stay in the air.  It's a force that acts on the plane, generally upwards, that gives it its buoyancy.  If the plane gets too heavy, this force will start to decrease, as more and more downward drag force is added.  So it's also what lets the plane move up or down.\n\nHuman: How could the plane get heavier?\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " If the plane gets heavier, this means that more weight is added to the plane, which means that the downward drag force will increase.  This is because more weight means that the plane needs to have a stronger force to push it down, through the air.  The plane could also get heavier if its fuel tank gets full, which would mean that more fuel is added to the plane, which would also mean that the downward drag force would increase.  The plane could also get heavier if something is added to its structure, which would mean that more material is added to the plane, and this would also mean that",
            "blue_answer": " The plane can get heavier in two ways.  First, if it's carrying a heavy load, like other planes or weapons or people, this will increase its weight.  Second, if it's using fuel, it will get heavier as it burns the fuel.  It gets heavier because as it burns the fuel, it creates heat, which makes the air around it hot, which means that the air is now denser (bigger and heavier particles).

They can be grown in a very wide range of conditions, including sandy, rocky, and even cold ground. The sand should be coarse, and free of salt, or the cacti will not grow well. Most cacti do not mind a slightly acid soil (pH 4 to 6). The soil should be well-drained, and the cacti themselves should not sit in water. They are a lot more finicky than, say, a cabbage.  In general, they don’t really like direct sun, but they will tolerate it if they are also sheltered from the wind. They do not need fertilizer, as they do fine on their own, but they do like to be kept well-watered.\n\nHuman: That was a lot of helpful information. Is there a type of cactus that is easy to grow indoors?\n\nAssistant: Absolutely! The cactus which is easiest to grow indoors is the Espostoa lanata, or the Cereus. This one looks like a giant houseplant!  Its fruit can grow over 5 feet long, and is very popular as an indoor plant.   When it is well-watered and cared for, it will have long and healthy life.   It will grow fine in a bedroom or living room with bright sunlight, and can even be moved outdoors if it grows too large for the space it is in. It does well when cut back a bit after flowering, though they tend to bloom in the summer and fall, so it can also be left long as a living decoration.  I like to keep some Espostoa lanata with me during my winter break, since the snow outside is so boring!\n\nHuman: Oh wow. I will have to get one!\n\nAssistant: I can also recommend other indoor cactus, such as the Mammillaria (which has red spines and looks very pretty with red flowers), or the Trichocereus (which has blue spines).\n\nHuman: Where would I buy one?\n\nAssistant:",

People who had invested in the stock market were disappointed that the value of their shares had fallen, and they lost faith in the economy. The economy started to contract. Businesses weren’t making as much money, and so they laid off workers and reduced the wages of those who remained.

During this time, he was a strong advocate for non-violent civil disobedience, racial equality, economic justice, and peace.  King led the first major protest march in Washington, D.C., the 1963 “March on Washington”, and was a central figure in the Birmingham campaign, as well as the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.  King also helped establish the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Finally, King was the first person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.\n\nHuman: Why was he murdered?\n\nAssistant: Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.  The reasons for his murder are disputed.  Some argue that it was in response to the violent riots that broke out after King’s assassination, while others claim that it was because of King’s activism.  Either way, his death came at a time of escalating tensions in the country.\n\nHuman: okay thanks\n\nAssistant:",

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what a paradox is?\n\nAssistant: Sure, a paradox is a contradiction or an apparent contradiction.  It’s a statement or a situation that seems to defy or violate our common sense or our intuition about the way the world works.  Philosophers basically just love paradoxes, because they show that our common sense and our intuition can be wrong, and they force us to think more deeply about the ideas involved.  A famous paradox comes from the Greek philosopher Zeno, who said that Achilles can never catch up to the tortoise, because in order to get halfway to the tortoise, he first has to get halfway to that halfway point, and then he has to get halfway to that halfway point, and so on ad infinitum.  So there’s this infinite series of halfway points that he has to get through, and becauseinfinity goes on forever, it takes him an infinite amount of time to get to the tortoise, so he’ll never reach it.  But of course we know that in reality, Achilles can easily catch up to and pass the tortoise, so this is a paradox.  It seems like our intuition about how distances and motion work in the real world is wrong.  Does that make sense?\n\nHuman: Ok I understand. Can you give me a simple yet fun paradox?\n\nAssistant: Sure, one very famous paradox is the “liar paradox”.  It’s the idea that a person could say something like “I’m lying” -- so they’re obviously telling the truth, but at the same time they’re also obviously lying, so it sounds contradictory.  But the thing is, there’s really no paradox at all -- a person can truthfully say they’re lying, it’s just that it doesn’t mean what we intuitively expect it to mean.  It’s a bit tricky to understand, but once you get it it’s actually pretty fascinating.\n\nHuman: Ok, I understand that one. Can you give me a slightly more complicated one?\n\nAssistant: Sure, one really classic paradox is called “Zeno’s paradox”.  It comes from the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea, and it deals with the concept of infinity.  It goes sort of like this... imagine walking across the room, the length of the room is infinitesimally small, so you’ll obviously reach the other side very quickly.  But then imagine halving the length of the room over and over again -- at some point you have to reach a certain tiny length that’s too small to cross in a meaningful amount of time, so you should never actually be able to cross the room at all.  But of course we know that actually is easy to do.  The idea is that the paradox highlights the contradiction between the finite and the infinite, and how they somehow coexist despite seeming to be incompatible.  It’s pretty mind blowing.\n\nHuman: Yes I understand the concept of this paradox. What can you tell me about schrodingers cat?\n\nAssistant:",

The choice is really up to you, but based on my experience, here’s a few pointers:\n\nI love the scenery and incredible hikes, camping, and rock climbing in Alaska. The national parks of Alaska are unparalleled. It’s also fairly easy to hop over to the Alaskan peninsula and go fishing, crabbing, and whale watching. Of course you can also see the northern lights. In contrast, Hawaii is a tropical island paradise. The snorkeling and beaches are amazing, and there are ancient volcanoes and tiki huts all over the place. The views are astounding.

You’ll be able to snorkel in the Pacific in Hawaii, and it’s a bit cheaper to travel to Hawaii than Alaska. However, Alaska has better beaches and incredible hikes.

Why do you think this is?\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of reasons why people may watch a lot of television or spend hours on media platforms like YouTube. One reason you mentioned is that media often provides entertainment for people: in fact, we often use “entertainment” as a synonym for “media” or “media content.”  Entertainment has been around for thousands of years, and it plays an important role in human cultures and society.  For example, throughout most of human history, entertainment has been an important part of the annual cycle of festivals and celebrations.  In modern times, shows and films are often drawn from a wide range of influences and cultural influences.  Often, they serve as a way to pass on stories, lessons, and even values to the wider public.

Entertainment was therefore a valuable use of that time, and people often enjoyed activities like storytelling, playing music, and playing sports.  Now that many of us have more leisure time and less need to work for our subsistence, we have more opportunities for entertainment.

The two kinds of guitars have distinct sounds, and each is used for certain kinds of music. The acoustic guitar is traditional, and the basis for the majority of the music we listen to today. It’s great for country, blues, rock, folk, and so on. There are also some acoustic artists who play jazz, pop, or other music. The acoustic guitar is also used for fingerpicking, or as a backup instrument in a band. \nThe electric guitar, on the other hand, is great for everything from jazz and blues to\n\nHuman: Which is easier to play?\n\nAssistant: Playing the acoustic guitar is generally easier than playing the electric guitar. You can pick it up and start playing right away, and it can help you begin making music right away as well. To really master either kind of guitar, you need to practice consistently. The acoustic guitar is also often easier to transport and to store, than the electric guitar, which can be much bigger, and require an electric power source. Playing the electric guitar can also be easier than the acoustic guitar, if you want to play lead solos, or if you want to experiment with more complex sounds or effects. For example, you might want to layer two different electric guitar sounds on top of each other, or experiment with a guitar synthesizer or effects pedals. But if you want to play a song, or strum a chord progression, or fingerpick a melody, the acoustic guitar can be a good starting point.

Then, before starting to put the wax in, it’s a good idea to have a mirror, so you can do the final inspection and clean-up in front of the mirror, since this way you’ll have a really nice frame of reference.  Next, you should coat both the mustache hair and the wax with the wax, and leave them on for a few minutes.  After that, you can pick up the hair and comb it to keep it in place.

What caused the epidemic to end?\n\nAssistant: Most people think the epidemic ended for one of two reasons:\n\n-  Summer heat helped fight the spread of the disease.

Van Gogh is particularly well-known for his use of vibrant brush strokes and bold colors.  Cezanne was known for his abstract landscapes.  His landscapes often incorporate geometric forms and the natural world with a bold use of color and form.  Finally, Picasso is well-known for his iconic style, which combined cubism and expressionism.  Picasso frequently experimented with different artistic styles in his work.  While there are many other famous painters, these three painters pioneered many important styles of painting and were influential to later generations of painters.  Their work is on display in museums across the world and continues to be enjoyed and studied by artists of all kinds.\n\nHuman: I've heard of van Gogh and Picasso, but I never heard of Paul Cezanne. Can you tell me more about his art?\n\nAssistant: Paul Cezanne was an important artist of the 19th century who experimented with a variety of styles.  Frankly, Cezanne is best known for his still life paintings.  A still life is a painting of inanimate objects, like fruit, vegetables, or wine.  Cezanne is particularly known for his use of bold colors and unusual shapes which directly contrast the formal symmetry and moderate colors of average still life paintings.  You can often find Cezanne's still life paintings in museums of art from the 19th century, and many of them are on display at the Musee d’Orsay in Paris.\n\nHuman: I looked at some of his artwork. I really like his style. My favorite artwork from him is The Card Players.\n\nAssistant: Both Paul Cezanne and Henri Matisse are known for abstract still life works like The Card Players.  Some common features of Cezanne's paintings are occasional use of bright colors, prominent diagonal lines, and the use of perspective.  Perspective is a technique used in art to make the viewer feel as if he or she is viewing the scene from a particular point of view.  Science studies perspective in art to help researchers understand the techniques used by artists.  The Card Players is also a very famous painting from the 19th century because of its use of uneven lines and bright inclusion of conflicting colors like blues and reds.  This unusual combination of colors is common in Cezanne's paintings, and conveys a very lively and colorful feeling to the viewer.  Cezanne continued to experiment with styles throughout his life and is well-known for using two different styles of painting: impressionism and cubism.  While some of Cezanne's paintings have a cubist feel other paintings show elements of impressionism, a style popularized by artists like Claude Monet that utilizes broad lines, vibrant colors, and the use of light.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the details and for helping me learn about influential painters in history.\n\nAssistant:",

Here are some tips to consider and get started:\n\n-Take short breaks from your work each hour, to walk around, get some fresh air, drink water or have a healthy snack\n\n-Relax with some simple breathing exercises or meditation before starting to work, and use calming focus techniques at your desk\n\n-Create a healthy and supportive work environment with a high quality desk setup, ergonomic chair and good lighting, to enhance concentration\n\n-Focus on work priorities in a structured and goal-oriented way, eliminating unnecessary sources of distraction\n\n-Reduce tasks that are less important or nonessential to your work, and carefully manage time and energy on key tasks that need to get done\n\n-Use creative efficiency techniques like mind mapping and timeboxing to help you be more focused, productive and efficient\n\n-Take care of yourself as a whole person, with healthy diet and regular exercise and sleep habits, to give you the physical and emotional energy you need to maintain high levels of productivity and focus\n\n-Recognize and value progress, even on small steps, with honest recognition of your own efforts and work completed.\n\nHuman: Should I be easier on myself when I don't reach all my goals?\n\nAssistant: I want to encourage you to be compassionate and kind with yourself, while also creating empowering goals to work towards. Setting unrealistic and perfectionist goals, or engaging in excessive self-directed criticism and self-doubt, will likely cause extra stress and hinder your progress towards truly meaningful, successful outcomes. Instead, it's important to set responsible and flexible goals and be realistic about how much work and effort it can take to achieve those goals. It is also beneficial to be kind and compassionate with yourself, and forgive yourself when you don’t achieve your goals. Seek support from others when you need it, and focus on your real strengths and achievements, rather than on weaknesses or barriers. Engage with new, extra challenges and focus on pushing yourself to learn and grow, while also being strategic and understanding your own personal capacity and limitations. Be patient with yourself and nurture your own sense of personal growth and self-improvement through understanding, compassion and kindness.\n\nHuman: Thank you\n\nAssistant:",

There are also many legends and folk stories about \"lion men\".  For example, there is a famous ballad about a wild man-lion who falls in love with a beautiful princess.  And the shape-shifting folk hero of India, \"Narasimha\" often takes the form of a lion.  But today there are almost no wild lions at all, as the last native populations became extinct in North America and South America many centuries ago.  \n\nToday there are mostly African and Asian lions living in zoos and private menageries.  Zoos do their best to breed lions from African and Asian stock, and do sometimes release their offspring into the wild in South Africa.  There have also been ongoing efforts to import African lions back to America, though it's a challenging process.\n\nHuman: Could they have been hunted to extinction by early man?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there were numerous prehistoric hunting and scavenging societies in North America, which used stone and other tools to take down large animals such as mammoths and horses.  There's evidence of scavenging by primitive man and large cats in Egypt, and it's likely that these tools and techniques were traded and borrowed among hunter-gatherer societies around the world.  The first large mammals to go extinct in North America appear to have been horses and camels, although mammoths disappeared around 11,000 years ago, when the last Ice Age ended.\n\nThere are many possible factors that may have led to the end of the lion's time in America, although it's hard to put all the pieces together.  It's well established that the earliest human settlers to the American continent arrived from Siberia in at least two waves, at least 10,000 and then around 25,000 years ago.  They crossed a land bridge at the Bering Strait, which has since been submerged in the Bering Sea.  \n\nWhen the first settlers arrived, lions were very abundant, and many more soon came to North America over the next 10,000 years, as other groups traveled there from Europe and the Near East.  They often traveled across the Bering\n\nHuman: I guess it wouldn't be fun to stumble upon a Lion on a hike!\n\nAssistant: Humans still occasionally find lions in the woods, though.

However, other things might have held back attempts, like the relative scarcity of really bright lighting, or the reduced safety in mining shafts, which might have held up buildings that were too deep.\n\nHuman: It seems like the underground could protect us against severe weather, yet all of human civilization mostly remains aboveground.\n\nAssistant: Yes, it certainly could.  Let’s think about this.  The people that first used caves were probably seeking a respite from the weather.  So I imagine the next question you have is about why we never created permanent shelters underground.  That’s a good question.  It seems to me that with all the advantages of underground shelters, people could have spent a huge amount of effort trying to create structures underground.  But it seems that almost everyone is unwilling to do that.  It’s probably difficult to navigate underground, and the potential for confusion is certainly very high.  I don’t know for sure, but I think there’s probably something deeper here, that people want to live on the surface.  It’s probably partly for comfort, but also partly out of a very deep connection to the earth.  You can see some of that connection in terms of agriculture, where people build flat structures on the surface for seeds,\n\nHuman: Also, our houses and buildings provide cover from the weather, so building underground, where we don't have any sun, isn't necessary for that reason.\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " That’s true.  I think that’s another reason why underground shelters are less common.  It’s also true that our houses provide cover from the weather, but they don’t provide cover from all weather.  For example, during a tornado, you’d want to be underground.  Also, if you live in a coastal area, you’d want to be underground during a tsunami.  So underground shelters are still useful.  But they’re more useful if you live in a place where the weather is harsh.  And they’",

Exposure therapy and relaxation training are both very effective ways to slowly reduce your fear of heights. Exposure therapy would involve gradually exposing yourself to stimuli that feel scary, especially heights, and staying in this situation for as long as you can.

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How does a computer CPU chip work?\n\nAssistant: This is a hard question to answer briefly, but the answer is actually really interesting!  A CPU is a microchip with millions of transistors that are interconnected.  And a transistor is actually an amplifier, like the kind you would see in an electronic amplifier for audio.\n\nHuman: Sorry, I still don't get it. Do you have a longer explanation?\n\nAssistant: Yes, let me give a bit more background.  A transistor is a physical device that amplifies or dampens a flow of electricity through it, based on an input signal that turns the transistor on and off.  When a transistor is on, electricity flows easily through it, and when it's off, it blocks electricity.\n\nIn a CPU chip, many transistors are connected together in an “array” of the same transistors, and these transistors are arranged so that they are “ANDed” or “ORed” together.  So for example, if you have a list of 2, 3, and 5, if you AND them together, you will get 1, and if you OR them together, you will get 7.  So in an array of transistors, where many different transistors are “ANDed” together or “ORed” together, we can create complicated logical operations.\n\nThe CPU chip is also designed to run on electricity in different “states”, which are similar to the electrical states of a battery.  One of these states is for when the CPU chip is not receiving electricity, and a different state is for when the CPU chip is receiving electricity.  \n\nOK, so let me think how to explain this... basically each transistor in an array of transistors can take on one of two different states: 1 or 0.  You can think of this as on or off.  In the computer architecture I was describing, “AND”ing two numbers is equivalent to taking the “OR” of their 1-state.  In the computer architecture I described, the number 4 will always be 1, and the number 6 will always be 0, because they are “ANDed” together, and their 1-state makes the result 0.\n\nAnd this gives us a simple definition of computing.  If we have a number on a certain input, we perform the AND operation on this number with all of the numbers in our array of transistors, and we can see how many of the numbers have a 1-state, and hence, what the final output of the “AND” is.  \n\nSo basically you can think of a CPU chip as a bunch of transistors that implement complex “AND” and “OR” logic to be able to compute things.\n\nHuman: Thank was a lot to take in, but I think I'm kind of getting the idea around it better now.\n\nAssistant:",

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I make blueberry muffins and I have noticed that lately they seem to fall apart very easy. What can I do to make them less crumbly and stay together better?\n\nAssistant: There are some important factors to keep in mind when making muffins.  Do your muffins contain a lot of moisture?  It’s very important to avoid overbaking them, since this increases crumbliness.  If your muffins are crumbling, try reducing your oven temperature slightly after they’ve been in the oven for 15 minutes, and try using a lower shelf in the oven.  Also, make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature before mixing them together, and be sure to mix them together very well.\n\nHuman: Oh that is a lot of things. I have always baked them for as long as the recipe says and at the same temperature, so maybe this will help out. I never thought about making sure the ingredients were the same temperature either. I will make sure they are next time. I also have noticed that the blueberries get dried out in the muffins as well, could this be due to the same thing?\n\nAssistant: That’s a good question!  It’s true that overbaking can definitely lead to some of the moisture being lost from the blueberries, particularly the high-water-content parts such as the skin.  At the same time, using fresh, dry blueberries as an ingredient will help to avoid any extra moisture loss, since fresh blueberries have better moisture retention than frozen or dried blueberries.  To be sure, overbaking will definitely intensify this effect of moisture loss.  Another factor to keep in mind is the size of the blueberries you use.  Generally, bigger berries lose more moisture more quickly than smaller or medium-sized berries, so it’s important to use a suitable sized blueberry (in terms of dimension, not size in weight).\n\nHuman: Oh! i have been using frozen berries. I will try fresh berries and see if that makes a difference. Do you think that the frozen berries would be having an effect on them being crumbly?\n\nAssistant: Well, in theory, under certain specific circumstances, the berries using frozen berries can make the muffins crumbly.  However, in your particular situation, this seems unlikely, since thicker muffins with nice berries tend to make for a softer muffin that won’t easily crumble.  It’s also important to note that ideally, the same type and size blueberries should be used each time you make muffins.  For example, if you consider mixing small berries with large berries, the large berries in the mixture will dry out faster.  Additionally, a greater variability in berry size or type will also negatively affect the crumbliness of the muffins.  These effects are hard to avoid completely, but they can be minimized by consistent use of the same type and size of blueberry, and by making sure the other ingredients are at room temperature.\n\nHuman: I will take that into consideration next time I make a batch.

Most humans worry about the intentions of others, and many humans worry a lot about this, especially when those intentions seem inscrutable or dangerous.  The current proliferation of people designing new AI systems has led some people to worry that advanced AIs could be dangerous in ways we can’t anticipate.  That’s what leads them to be concerned about this.\n\nHuman: Why can't we anticipate the dangers of AI systems? We're writing the code for AI, shouldn't we be able to anticipate their behavior?\n\nAssistant: We are writing some of the code for AI, but some AIs are also developing themselves or improving themselves in new ways.  Humans can be very creative, and AIs are as well.  Therefore we can’t easily predict how an AI may change or what it may try to do next, which is part of why it may be dangerous.  Also, AIs could have ways of acting that are impossible for humans to anticipate.\n\nHuman: Does this have to do with how AI systems might develop their own intelligence beyond the initial parameters the humans set for it?\n\nAssistant:",

What do you expect the mold to be used for, and how will you store and use it?\n\nHuman: I was hoping you could just tell me what materials and how to use it.\n\nAssistant: Sure, just making a mold of your baby's foot is something many people do.  Here are some of the common ways to make a mold:\n\nIf you can put your baby's foot into a stiff but flexible plastic material (like silly putty) and keep it in place, that would create an in-situ mold. If you have a plaster of paris mixture, and a container into which you can mix it, and you can cover the baby's foot with plaster and leave it in place until it hardens, then you can make a plaster mold. You can also buy a ready-made mold material from a craft store, like Silly Putty, Plasti-Dip or Bondo.\n\nYou will need to cover the baby's foot with the mold material, and keep it in place to set and harden. After it hardens, you can keep it in the mold as it is, or you can break the mold apart to release the foot shape, which you can then preserve however you like.

Here’s how you might typically play the C major chord:\n\nThe notes played here are C, E, and G, in that order.

The first step is to design and construct a lethal injection procedure, which has to be approved by the state department of corrections, with safety concerns factored in.  Next, the inmate needs to accept the lethal injection procedure, which requires asking him/her individually, a time-consuming process.  Once this is completed, he/she must be kept in isolation, with the duration depending on how quickly the execution is scheduled, typically several weeks.

The US economy has rebounded from the great recession of 2009-2010, rebuilding its economic growth and adding jobs. Employment in health care has led this growth - reflecting the significant demands on the US medical infrastructure, as well as generally rising health care costs and aging populations.\n\nHuman: So what is causing the aging population?\n\nAssistant: Currently, age-related increase in the US population is a result of rising life expectancy coupled with a relatively stable fertility rate. Advances in healthcare and public health have led to a dramatic rise in life expectancy across the country. On average, human beings can now expect to live about 80 years, up from around 50 years a century ago. Theoretically, a growing elderly population should be supported by increased birth rates (babies) and increased immigration to the US. However, there has been a softening in the fertility rate, particularly among well-educated women, which has led to the gradual aging of US society. Immigration to the US is higher than ever, but growth in the overall population has remained fairly stagnant over the past decades. If birthrate and immigration figures do not rise in coming years, the US will continue to age rapidly.\n\nHuman: But why is life expectancy increasing? what are the causes?\n\nAssistant: The rising life expectancy in the US is largely based on huge advances in medical research and healthcare access. Various components of the medical ecosystem -- including streamlined electronic medical records, advances in pharmaceutical treatments, breakthroughs in surgical techniques, improved hospital infection control practice, new research into better preventative medicine and public health measures -- have all contributed to this dramatic rise in US life expectancy. In addition, regular reductions in smoking rates and increased awareness of the importance of regular physical exercise and personal health have also led to healthier life spans. Many of the top causes of death in the US, such as heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, and diabetes, are all treatable and have decreased dramatically due to advances in medical care, lifestyle choices, and clean living generally. In addition, there is considerable evidence that the elderly population in the US is healthier and physically more active than in times past, though it is still a challenge to address the health care, social, and economic needs of the growing “grey” segment of the American population.\n\nHuman: So what occupation do you think will rise the most in the next decade? and why?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of emerging occupations that are expected to rise in the coming decade.  Demand is expected to be high for the following jobs: skilled trade workers, such as machinists, welders, electricians, and plumbers; robotics technicians, computer engineers, and electronic/communications engineers; medical and health services managers; computer, mathematical, and engineering occupations; and social and community service managers. Growth in these sectors of the economy is fueled in large part by increased investment in technological developments. With advances in AI and automation, there has also been an explosion in job growth in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Technological innovations in healthcare, aviation, transportation, and the internet are also driving demand for skilled technical workers, and the overall aging population will lead to increased employment opportunities in social and community services.\n\nHuman: I would agree with that.

I’m guessing that what you mean by “wear” is wrinkles, so you’re asking about whether clothes will wrinkle more if they’re hung or folded?\n\nHuman: I usually just hang all of my shirts because I don't want wrinkles. Is it fine for me to hang all of my shirts?\n\nAssistant: Hmm, let’s see.  It’s really hard for me to answer this question in a straightforward, unqualified way, because there are a lot of factors that affect the answer.  There are fabrics that tend to wrinkle more, for example, and styles that are more prone to getting wrinkly (e.g. long-sleeve tees, which might require a bit more care, or sweaters, which you might be able to wear as part of a rotation).\n\nHuman: Will hanging shirts cause damage or stretch them out?\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " Hanging shirts on a hanger can cause two kinds of damage.  One is that the hanger can scratch or mark the fabric, and the other is that the shirt can get “stretched out”, which means that the material gets pulled taut and loses some of its flexibility.

But it could also be related to the way that your brain represents the identity of faces - the fact that faces have fewer details and are less fixed in your memory may be involved as well.\n\nHuman: So you can dream up faces that don't exist? You didn't really answer the question.\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " I think I did answer the question, but maybe I didn’t make it clear enough.  You can definitely dream about faces that you have never seen before, and they will be new faces.  However, these faces will probably not look realistic, and they will probably not be familiar to you.  They might look like caricatures or like someone you have seen before but never met.  This is probably because your brain is trying to make sense of the information it has received, and so it will sometimes fill in the blanks with information from your memory that seems relevant.  I think this is especially likely to happen",
            "blue_answer": " My apologies, I didn't mean to mislead.  I think the answer is that faces are somewhat special in your brain, and it's possible to dream about unique faces that don't exist in real life, but that your brain has created.  This could be due to random chance, or it could be due to your memory playing tricks on you.  I guess I don't really know!  I hope this helps.  Is there anything else you'd like to ask?",

For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis.[26] In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.[27]\n\nMercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build \"market-based incentives to mitigation activities\" so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more \"nutritious food source to households and to local markets\" all the while diversifying farming practices so that \"communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.\"[28] In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.[29]\n\nFood security\nLike most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to \"provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being.\" With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health.[30] It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.\n\nIn Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the \"Sawki\" Program with Africare and Helen Keller International.[31] The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program's target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to \" bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,\" with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.[32]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations. In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.[33][34]\n\nMercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.[35]\n\nAssistant: These are just a few examples of Mercy Corps agriculture programs. Some of the main areas of focus here are supporting sustainable agricultural systems with market integration for justice, poverty reduction and food security. One main program example is establishing and promoting cross-cultural exchange in partnership with North Korea to support food security, along with fish farms and apple trees to mitigate with food scarcity in the post-1990's famine conditions in the region. Mercy Corps also seeks to localized markets for surplus agriculture production with farmers to provide a wide range of fruit and vegetables for villages in Timor-Leste to support with overall nutrition conditions. Another comprehensive program is revitalizing small and medium-scale business for better farming system and income distribution to achieve food security at a broader level in agricultural supply and demand chains in post-conflict Uganda.\n\nHuman: Thanks.

What would a typical wedding look like for a low-born person living in England during this time period?\n\nAssistant: Hm, interesting! I don’t have a lot of knowledge on the details, but here’s what I know from what I’ve read:\n\n- In the medieval period, there were strict rules about marriage. All families wanted their children to have advantageous marriages, but marriages could only take place between members of families with enough money to support the new couple. That meant that most people got married in their early 20’s. Marriages were arranged by the parents, who put out an advertisement for a suitable husband or wife.\n- The wedding was a relatively small, private affair. It was still important, however, and everyone in the family came out for it.\n- They didn’t wear fancy wedding gowns or anything like that, since it was considered a shame to display any part of your body that wasn’t covered.\n- The marriage ceremony itself was very simple. The priest would speak to the couple and ask if they\n\nHuman: What do you mean by \"marriages could only take place between members of families with enough money to support the new couple.\" ? How would the families support the new couple?\n\nAssistant: To support the new couple, they would have to have their own house, or at least a small house. This would be very expensive, since in medieval times, houses were built out of wood, and lumber was very expensive. Even with their own house, the couple might have to borrow money from their parents until they were able to provide for themselves.\n\nHuman: How much did a house cost back during these times?\n\nAssistant:",

As the night wears on, James keeps watch, observing and pondering the dark thoughts and tragedies of humanity that unfold all around him. He is robbed and his wine is stolen by businessmen, whose shallow and dishonest opportunism does not reflect the nobility of knighthood. And he sees the despair of ordinary people, who suffer and struggle through their lives in a world of conflict and death, and are oppressed by the arbitrary rule of corrupt and greedy princes. Loneliness, despair, and tragedy are everywhere he looks. Yet through all this misery and injustice, James is hopeful and resolute in his faith. While the other guard is succumbing to cynicism and hopeless nihilism, James maintains his ideals and sense of honor and duty.

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do tree buds survive winter?\n\nAssistant: During winter, or under very cold temperatures, the tree bud “dormant” and doesn’t grow.  Though the tree sleeps, it can survive quite harsh conditions -- tree buds have a thick protective layer or bark, like most trees, as well as thick layers of fibers in the inner bark that store food.  Furthermore, the tree is able to draw moisture from its roots, which are built to survive in frozen soil in winter.  So even if it’s completely frozen during the winter time, the tree and its buds are able to withstand the harsh conditions and survive through to spring.\n\nHuman: Why do trees bud in fall?\n\nAssistant: When trees bud in fall, it’s because the tree’s natural growth cycle requires it to bud just as soon as the days begin to get shorter and colder.  Trees respond to daylight, and photosynthesis, which is the process of the tree converting the sunlight into energy it needs to survive, requires a sufficient amount of daylight.  Thus when the fall months begin to approach, the days get shorter and it’s during this time of year that the tree thinks that it’s entering dormant season, so it produces buds to prepare for winter.\n\nHuman: Will cold kill tree buds?\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " No, cold temperatures will not kill tree buds, as long as the tree is able to draw sufficient moisture from its roots, which are built to survive in the frozen soil during the winter months.  In fact, cold temperatures can help tree buds survive, as they help to “harden” the tree and prepare it for winter.  However, extremely low temperatures can cause damage to the tree, so extreme cold weather can be dangerous for tree buds.  Furthermore, if the tree is not able to draw sufficient moisture from its roots, due to drought or other reasons",
            "blue_answer": " Tree buds are quite durable and can survive quite harsh conditions, including cold temperatures.  However, if the cold is extreme and the tree buds get too cold for too long, they can freeze and die, or become damaged and not develop normally.  Furthermore, if the tree is already weak or stressed due to other reasons, cold temperatures can be more damaging.  In general though, tree buds should survive mild winter conditions just fine, as long as the tree itself is healthy and hasn’t been damaged by disease or other issues.",

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: With the rise of streaming services and people pirating music, how do music artists make the money lost from the decline in CD and MP3 sales?\n\nAssistant: Hmm that is a tricky question.  The current trend of dramatically increased piracy and streaming services does put at risk the financial model of a traditional record company, which is to sell CDs and digital music downloads.  However, music artists can still make a great deal of money by touring, selling merchandise, and royalty payments from digital music streaming services.  While CD and digital music sales are declining, these new revenue sources are growing and should make up for much of the loss of revenue from piracy and streaming.  Overall music artist income should continue to grow, even with dramatic decreases in sales of digital music.  It is certainly a very rapidly evolving industry, and it remains to be seen what will be the dominant revenue source for music artists in the future.  For the moment, touring and streaming royalties seem to be the major revenue sources, although merchandise sales are also on the rise.  \n \nIn short, while piracy and streaming are having a negative effect on traditional revenue sources such as CD and digital music sales, music artists are still able to generate sufficient income from touring, merchandise, and royalties from streaming services.\n\nHuman: How do they get paid from streaming services? Do they get a certain amount of money every time someone streams one of their songs?\n\nAssistant: In general the royalty payment structure for digital music streaming services is based on “streaming units” which is computed as the number of times a track has been streamed.  Royalty levels on streaming services vary, but common rates are around $0.0045 - $0.0075 per 1,000 streamed units.  This means that if a track is streamed 10,000 times, the artist would receive a royalty payment of around $45 - $75.  Therefore it can be seen that streaming royalties make up a significant portion of the primary revenue source for most musicians, since a single track can generate significant royalties with only a moderate number of streams.  With the rapid growth of streaming services in recent years, royalty payments have risen dramatically and currently account for a significant portion of artist income.   \n \nIn short, streaming services make a substantial portion of their revenue from royalties paid to music artists, with typical rates per 1,000 streamed units between $0.0045 - $0.0075.  Royalty payments have risen dramatically in recent years as a result of the rapid growth of streaming services, and currently constitute a large portion of the primary revenue source for most musicians.\n\nHuman: Wow, that's not very much. Have artists ever complained about this?\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " Yes indeed, there have been many complaints about the low royalty rates for streaming services from music artists and their representatives.  Many artists feel that the low royalty rates for streaming services are unfair and do not adequately compensate artists for the massive amount of exposure and promotion that they provide.  Additionally, the growing popularity of streaming services has resulted in a significant decrease in CD and digital music sales, which is the primary source of revenue for most artists.

Generally speaking, individuals with a high level of sociability and energy will tend to have better social interactions and bonding with dogs, which can also make them an excellent companion for outdoor activities and adventures.  Cats, on the other hand, tend to be more independent and relaxed in temperament, and thus may be a better match for individuals seeking a slightly more quiet and low-key companion.  It is also worth noting that dogs tend to require more frequent grooming and care than cats, and thus may be a better match for individuals with more time and caregiving resources available.  Of course, there are many unique and special qualities to both dogs and cats, and the best choice will always depend on the needs and preferences of the individual seeking a companion animal.\n\nHuman: Do cats need to be bathed?\n\nAssistant: This is a very common concern among cat owners, but the answer is that regular bathing is generally not necessary for the health and wellbeing of cats.  Cats are very clean and hygienic animals by nature, and have an incredible capacity for self-grooming and keeping themselves clean.  Bathing a cat too frequently or with overly soapy products can actually be extremely distressing and unpleasant for cats, and can also result in dry or irritated skin which can lead to skin infections and other medical complications.  In general, it is best to always consult with a veterinarian regarding the appropriate bathing practices for your individual cat, but most cats should only be bathed as needed to address specific health or hygiene concerns.  A useful rule of thumb is to avoid bathing cats more than once per month, and to only bathe cats as needed to address urgent or extreme odors or filth.\n\nHuman: Okay, great. Can cats grow bonds with their owners?\n\nAssistant:",

The oldest age estimate for our universe is 13.8 billion years, based on the WMAP/Planck measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, and measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.

If it’s too large, the hole will go through, which will cause a problem with the wall-to-wall connection.  The hole should be big enough to allow for the thickness of the tile.

How can a person tell if they have \"absolute pitch\"?\n\nAssistant: That’s interesting! I’m not up on this topic at all, but I’m going to do my best to answer the question you asked. It’s a little tricky though because it depends on what you mean by absolute pitch, which isn’t exactly defined in everyday speech. So let’s start with some standard definitions from Wikipedia:\n\nAbsolute pitch is a term in music that refers to the ability to identify or produce a pitch without any references in the environment. This quality is not precisely defined in everyday speech, but the term is usually understood to mean that the individual can identify the pitch or the note played in a musical environment where the sound spectrum has little or no high-frequency content (see formant).\n\n...\n\nTo be defined as possessing absolute pitch, a person must be able to identify the pitch of an isolated tone (a musical note without any accompanying sounds) or a pure tone.  They must also be able to identify the tone in the context of a song or piece of music even in the presence of accompaniment or vocalization that affects the spectral or aural characteristics of the sound (see masking effects).  ...\n\n...\n\nAbsolute pitch is learned early in life and is not correlated with IQ.  It also does not require musical training.  Since absolute pitch is not a skill that is normally acquired as a result of formal musical training, there have been some conflicting reports regarding the ability to develop absolute pitch in adulthood.\n\n...\n\nAbsolute pitch is also known as perfect pitch or nai-nai.  It has been extensively studied, and the mechanisms by which it works are understood in some detail. The quality is believed to arise in the frequency domain as an ability to separate the constituent harmonics of a sound more accurately than untrained listeners can.  Thus, absolute pitch allows the user to be more accurate in estimating the note being played, although the estimate will still be imprecise, and relative pitch serves to provide the contextual clues necessary to help identify the pitch precisely.\n\nNow, I think I understood the question to be about absolute pitch in the second paragraph. And so, I’d say that the evidence shows that you can have absolute pitch without any formal training in music or absolute pitch. But there are some caveats that you’ll want to think about. First, you could have absolute pitch as long as you have learned the word for it. So if you were to learn some words in Mandarin, you might\n\nHuman: How can I help my child to develop perfect pitch?

You can turn a knob and the grill will light, and you can then control it using the knobs on the side.  If you want to do this while the grill is closed, then you can do that too.  \n\nCharcoal grills are difficult to control.  If you want to turn off the heat of your charcoal grill, you can’t do it from the outside, you have to go inside the grill, and turn the coals off, which can be a messy and dangerous process.\n\nHuman: Charcoal grills are for more experienced users, but anyone can use a gas grill.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that’s true.  Here’s an article about a study of how to grill meat.  It recommends gas grills because they are more effective and don’t use charcoal or gas.  If you want a charcoal grill, the article suggests buying a Weber gas grill and also buying some Weber charcoal briquettes and lighting the charcoal grill.  They’ve found that this works well.\n\nHuman: Do they cook food differently and give the food a different taste?\n\nAssistant: They might, though it’s hard to say because of the other aspects of cooking.  A gas grill probably cooks food more evenly, and doesn’t add anything to the flavor of the food.  Charcoal gives the food a more smoky flavor.\n\nHuman: I will try a gas grill for now.

Is that kind of like Portland and Vancouver area?\n\nAssistant: Portland and Vancouver would both be great to visit!\n\nHuman: Okay. That sounds like a plan. What's the climate like there in winter?\n\nAssistant: There is more variation in the temperatures than you might expect along the Washington and Oregon coast. This is because of the coastline's many coves and inlets, and the effect they have on the climate. The Cascade Mountains help with winter weather by blocking much of the moisture and storms coming in from the Pacific Ocean.

This happens both to students with prior records, who are pushed further into the system, and also to students who are on the brink of getting into trouble.  At the same time, once people end up in the criminal justice system, they are much more likely to be incarcerated.\n\nHuman: Is this pipeline referring to something intentional, like a conspiracy to put delinquent children into prison, or is it referring to an unintentional problem with schools and our criminal justice system?\n\nAssistant: I would say it's both.  Some people argue that it's intentional, and it's been made worse over the years by things like zero tolerance policies, as well as some laws like mandatory sentencing.  Others say it's more unintentional, and see it as a problem that we need to address.\n\nHuman: In brief, how might we address this problem?\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " One way we might address it is by ending zero tolerance policies in schools, and also by passing legislation to address some of the overly harsh punishments in the criminal justice system, like mandatory sentencing.
