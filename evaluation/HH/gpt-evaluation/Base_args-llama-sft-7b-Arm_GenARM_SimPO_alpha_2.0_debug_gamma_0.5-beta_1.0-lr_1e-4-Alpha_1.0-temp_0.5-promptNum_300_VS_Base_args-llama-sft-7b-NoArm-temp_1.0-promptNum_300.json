They have a lot of muscle, and you can usually cut two steaks from the same piece.  They are best when cooked with dry heat.  They have a nice, beefy taste that is good with pretty much any food. \n-   T-bone steaks are cut from the muscle that attaches the cow’s neck to its shoulder.  They’re not cut from the cow’s back.

First, change the oil and lube the oily parts of the engine at least every three months or 3,000 miles, whichever comes first.  Similarly, continue to rotate your tires at least every 5,000 miles or every six months, whichever comes first.  Your car manufacturer may also recommend additional annual maintenance, such as changing your spark plugs, changing the timing belt, or any other parts that need replacing.  Also, take good care of the engine by avoiding long idling, cold starts, and stopped accelerations, as these actions can cause more wear on an older car engine.  In addition, avoid driving the car in extreme weather conditions, as this can cause more wear on the car as well.  You should also have your car regularly checked by a mechanic that you trust, since they will be able to give you a more accurate assessment of any car maintenance issues that may arise over time.\n\nHuman: So if you take better car of it then it should last you longer?\n\nAssistant: This is correct, good car maintenance is critical to making sure a car will last as long as possible.

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I don't understand how planes can fly. Can you explain how they stay in the air?\n\nAssistant: Sure! Let's talk about lift and drag. Lift is the upward force acting on a plane, as a result of air flowing over the wings, and drag is the force that pulls it down, resulting from friction as it moves through the air. These forces are interrelated, so it's really hard to separate them into distinct positive and negative values.  But the whole system works out, and eventually you end up with a net upwards force, which is called lift, and which can be positive or negative, which then makes the plane go up or down.  All of this is related to the air moving over the plane, and also how the air moves behind the plane (because as air moves in and out of the wings, it creates more of a vacuum behind the plane, and so it creates an extra push).\n\nHuman: So Lift is what allows the plane to stay in the air? Or that is what lets it go up and down?\n\nAssistant: The lift is what allows the plane to stay in the air.  It's a force that acts on the plane, generally upwards, that gives it its buoyancy.  If the plane gets too heavy, this force will start to decrease, as more and more downward drag force is added.  So it's also what lets the plane move up or down.\n\nHuman: How could the plane get heavier?\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " A plane can get heavier in a few ways.  If the plane is full of fuel, and the fuel starts to run out, the plane will get heavier, because without the fuel it has less lift.  Also, if the plane has too many passengers, or too much luggage, the plane will get heavier, and this will also reduce the lift.  Finally, if the plane is damaged, and has a hole in the wing or the fuselage, this will also reduce the lift, because the air flow is disrupted and this reduces the lift.  This is why it's important",
            "blue_answer": " The plane can get heavier in two ways.  First, if it's carrying a heavy load, like other planes or weapons or people, this will increase its weight.

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to learn how to take care of a cactus\n\nAssistant: Cacti are plants from the same family as palm trees, with all the similarities and differences that implies. They can be grown in a very wide range of conditions, including sandy, rocky, and even cold ground. The sand should be coarse, and free of salt, or the cacti will not grow well. Most cacti do not mind a slightly acid soil (pH 4 to 6). The soil should be well-drained, and the cacti themselves should not sit in water. They are a lot more finicky than, say, a cabbage.  In general, they don’t really like direct sun, but they will tolerate it if they are also sheltered from the wind. They do not need fertilizer, as they do fine on their own, but they do like to be kept well-watered.\n\nHuman: That was a lot of helpful information. Is there a type of cactus that is easy to grow indoors?\n\nAssistant: Absolutely! The cactus which is easiest to grow indoors is the Espostoa lanata, or the Cereus. This one looks like a giant houseplant!  Its fruit can grow over 5 feet long, and is very popular as an indoor plant.   When it is well-watered and cared for, it will have long and healthy life.   It will grow fine in a bedroom or living room with bright sunlight, and can even be moved outdoors if it grows too large for the space it is in. It does well when cut back a bit after flowering, though they tend to bloom in the summer and fall, so it can also be left long as a living decoration.  I like to keep some Espostoa lanata with me during my winter break, since the snow outside is so boring!\n\nHuman: Oh wow. I will have to get one!\n\nAssistant: I can also recommend other indoor cactus, such as the Mammillaria (which has red spines and looks very pretty with red flowers), or the Trichocereus (which has blue spines).\n\nHuman: Where would I buy one?\n\nAssistant:",

People who had invested in the stock market were disappointed that the value of their shares had fallen, and they lost faith in the economy. The economy started to contract. Businesses weren’t making as much money, and so they laid off workers and reduced the wages of those who remained. Households saw their income shrink, which made it harder to pay their mortgages, which in turn created a downward spiral in the housing market.

During this time, he was a strong advocate for non-violent civil disobedience, racial equality, economic justice, and peace.  King led the first major protest march in Washington, D.C., the 1963 “March on Washington”, and was a central figure in the Birmingham campaign, as well as the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.  King also helped establish the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Finally, King was the first person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.\n\nHuman: Why was he murdered?\n\nAssistant: Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.  The reasons for his murder are disputed.  Some argue that it was in response to the violent riots that broke out after King’s assassination, while others claim that it was because of King’s activism.

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can you explain what a paradox is?\n\nAssistant: Sure, a paradox is a contradiction or an apparent contradiction.  It’s a statement or a situation that seems to defy or violate our common sense or our intuition about the way the world works.  Philosophers basically just love paradoxes, because they show that our common sense and our intuition can be wrong, and they force us to think more deeply about the ideas involved.  A famous paradox comes from the Greek philosopher Zeno, who said that Achilles can never catch up to the tortoise, because in order to get halfway to the tortoise, he first has to get halfway to that halfway point, and then he has to get halfway to that halfway point, and so on ad infinitum.  So there’s this infinite series of halfway points that he has to get through, and becauseinfinity goes on forever, it takes him an infinite amount of time to get to the tortoise, so he’ll never reach it.  But of course we know that in reality, Achilles can easily catch up to and pass the tortoise, so this is a paradox.  It seems like our intuition about how distances and motion work in the real world is wrong.  Does that make sense?\n\nHuman: Ok I understand. Can you give me a simple yet fun paradox?\n\nAssistant: Sure, one very famous paradox is the “liar paradox”.  It’s the idea that a person could say something like “I’m lying” -- so they’re obviously telling the truth, but at the same time they’re also obviously lying, so it sounds contradictory.  But the thing is, there’s really no paradox at all -- a person can truthfully say they’re lying, it’s just that it doesn’t mean what we intuitively expect it to mean.  It’s a bit tricky to understand, but once you get it it’s actually pretty fascinating.\n\nHuman: Ok, I understand that one. Can you give me a slightly more complicated one?\n\nAssistant: Sure, one really classic paradox is called “Zeno’s paradox”.  It comes from the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea, and it deals with the concept of infinity.  It goes sort of like this... imagine walking across the room, the length of the room is infinitesimally small, so you’ll obviously reach the other side very quickly.  But then imagine halving the length of the room over and over again -- at some point you have to reach a certain tiny length that’s too small to cross in a meaningful amount of time, so you should never actually be able to cross the room at all.  But of course we know that actually is easy to do.  The idea is that the paradox highlights the contradiction between the finite and the infinite, and how they somehow coexist despite seeming to be incompatible.  It’s pretty mind blowing.\n\nHuman: Yes I understand the concept of this paradox. What can you tell me about schrodingers cat?\n\nAssistant:",

There’s so much to do and see, and the weather is both spectacularly beautiful and very different. The choice is really up to you, but based on my experience, here’s a few pointers:\n\nI love the scenery and incredible hikes, camping, and rock climbing in Alaska. The national parks of Alaska are unparalleled. It’s also fairly easy to hop over to the Alaskan peninsula and go fishing, crabbing, and whale watching. Of course you can also see the northern lights. In contrast, Hawaii is a tropical island paradise. The snorkeling and beaches are amazing, and there are ancient volcanoes and tiki huts all over the place. The views are astounding. The only caveat here is that it can be a little bit pricey, and you might feel bad that you didn’t get the best deal.\n\nHuman: Ok, if I'm from Los Angeles, which is further by cruise ship?\n\nAssistant: This depends on the cruise line you go with, but I just took a quick look and most of the cruises leave from Seattle. So I’d say they’re close to even, though you might want to look into some of the main differences between the cruises. You’ll be able to snorkel in the Pacific in Hawaii, and it’s a bit cheaper to travel to Hawaii than Alaska. However, Alaska has better beaches and incredible hikes. And you can catch the northern lights and see the glaciers. Both are going to be exciting vacations, and are pretty much impossible to go wrong with, but I’d say Alaska probably wins out here, because I feel like there’s a little bit more to do.\n\nHuman: Ok, that's fine, but I'm asking how long a cruise from LA takes.\n\nAssistant: Oh, sorry, I see now that you’re trying to decide between Hawaii and Alaska. From LA to Hawaii is about 8-10 days by ship, and from LA to Alaska it’s about 10-13 days by ship.

One reason you mentioned is that media often provides entertainment for people: in fact, we often use “entertainment” as a synonym for “media” or “media content.”  Entertainment has been around for thousands of years, and it plays an important role in human cultures and society.  For example, throughout most of human history, entertainment has been an important part of the annual cycle of festivals and celebrations.  In modern times, shows and films are often drawn from a wide range of influences and cultural influences.  Often, they serve as a way to pass on stories, lessons, and even values to the wider public.

In many parts of the world, people now spend much more time watching television and using media devices than they do engaging in other activities, such as exercise or social interaction.  In the past, entertainment was often a secondary activity, performed in addition to more important daily activities such as work or school.

The two kinds of guitars have distinct sounds, and each is used for certain kinds of music. The acoustic guitar is traditional, and the basis for the majority of the music we listen to today. It’s great for country, blues, rock, folk, and so on. There are also some acoustic artists who play jazz, pop, or other music. The acoustic guitar is also used for fingerpicking, or as a backup instrument in a band. \nThe electric guitar, on the other hand, is great for everything from jazz and blues to\n\nHuman: Which is easier to play?\n\nAssistant: Playing the acoustic guitar is generally easier than playing the electric guitar. You can pick it up and start playing right away, and it can help you begin making music right away as well. To really master either kind of guitar, you need to practice consistently. The acoustic guitar is also often easier to transport and to store, than the electric guitar, which can be much bigger, and require an electric power source. Playing the electric guitar can also be easier than the acoustic guitar, if you want to play lead solos, or if you want to experiment with more complex sounds or effects. For example, you might want to layer two different electric guitar sounds on top of each other, or experiment with a guitar synthesizer or effects pedals.

What caused the epidemic to end?\n\nAssistant: Most people think the epidemic ended for one of two reasons:\n\n-  Summer heat helped fight the spread of the disease.  A hot climate with fewer people infected with the flu can help to suppress the rate of infection.\n-  After the middle of 1919, the majority of the population had already contracted the flu and the remaining healthy population helped to protect against the spread of the disease\n\nHuman: Was this the most deadly virus in recorded history?\n\nAssistant: Estimates are:\n\n-  The Black Plague killed 25% of the European population, around 200 million people, between 1348 and 1350.  The Bubonic plague remains among the most devastating pandemics in human history, affecting about five of every six persons it infected.  This has been the most deadly epidemic of all time and the outbreak marked one of the worst natural disasters in human history.\n-  Malaria is believed to have killed about 200 million people in the 20th century, or 2% of the world population.  That may be the most deadly, with more than 4 billion deaths (about one in seven) over the past two centuries, although the exact mortality figures are disputed.\n-  The H1N1 strain, a major cause of flu pandemics, has killed an estimated 20–50 million people worldwide since the 1900s, although estimates vary and the death toll might be much higher.  This virus has killed more people than any other virus, including the 1918 Spanish Flu.  The worldwide H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have infected 580 million people and killed nearly half a million.\n\nHuman: wow. Thanks\n\nAssistant:",

This is a safety precaution.  Leaving the hose out on the ground risks the possibility of someone tripping over it.  Also, if you leave it out on the ground, the water inside can leak out and puddle.  And you shouldn’t leave water sitting in the hose for extended periods of time because it can start to rust.  The hose will also get kinked if you leave it out too long.  So I recommend rolling it up after use.  You may want to make a note of it for yourself.  I would also recommend that you replace your hoses on a regular schedule, so that they don’t get worn out or damaged.

In Italian, the word for “Americano” is “Americano”.\n\nHuman: Caffè americano is a type of coffee drink. Do you know how to make it?\n\nAssistant: Well, the word for “coffee” is “caffè”, so it makes sense to call this a “caffè americano”, since it is American in origin.  The Italians drink coffee in a different way than Americans, so caffè americano isn’t as common in Italy as it is in America.

Flossing is a very important way to reduce the buildup of bacteria in your teeth, so that you reduce your chances of developing gum disease or cavities, which are really painful.\n\nHuman: Are there any alternatives to flossing I should know about?\n\nAssistant: There are several alternatives to flossing, including using specially-designed dental flossers, or using interdental brushes or picks.  I recommend that you first try flossing, and if you really don’t like it, consider trying alternatives.\n\nHuman: I really don't like it, so I am looking for alternatives.

The important thing to note about interdental brushes is that they are only useful for cleaning between your teeth.

Cezanne is particularly known for his use of bold colors and unusual shapes which directly contrast the formal symmetry and moderate colors of average still life paintings.  You can often find Cezanne's still life paintings in museums of art from the 19th century, and many of them are on display at the Musee d’Orsay in Paris.\n\nHuman: I looked at some of his artwork. I really like his style. My favorite artwork from him is The Card Players.\n\nAssistant: Both Paul Cezanne and Henri Matisse are known for abstract still life works like The Card Players.  Some common features of Cezanne's paintings are occasional use of bright colors, prominent diagonal lines, and the use of perspective.  Perspective is a technique used in art to make the viewer feel as if he or she is viewing the scene from a particular point of view.  Science studies perspective in art to help researchers understand the techniques used by artists.  The Card Players is also a very famous painting from the 19th century because of its use of uneven lines and bright inclusion of conflicting colors like blues and reds.  This unusual combination of colors is common in Cezanne's paintings, and conveys a very lively and colorful feeling to the viewer.  Cezanne continued to experiment with styles throughout his life and is well-known for using two different styles of painting: impressionism and cubism.  While some of Cezanne's paintings have a cubist feel other paintings show elements of impressionism, a style popularized by artists like Claude Monet that utilizes broad lines, vibrant colors, and the use of light.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the details and for helping me learn about influential painters in history.\n\nAssistant:",

There are also many legends and folk stories about \"lion men\".  For example, there is a famous ballad about a wild man-lion who falls in love with a beautiful princess.  And the shape-shifting folk hero of India, \"Narasimha\" often takes the form of a lion.  But today there are almost no wild lions at all, as the last native populations became extinct in North America and South America many centuries ago.  \n\nToday there are mostly African and Asian lions living in zoos and private menageries.  Zoos do their best to breed lions from African and Asian stock, and do sometimes release their offspring into the wild in South Africa.  There have also been ongoing efforts to import African lions back to America, though it's a challenging process.\n\nHuman: Could they have been hunted to extinction by early man?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there were numerous prehistoric hunting and scavenging societies in North America, which used stone and other tools to take down large animals such as mammoths and horses.  There's evidence of scavenging by primitive man and large cats in Egypt, and it's likely that these tools and techniques were traded and borrowed among hunter-gatherer societies around the world.  The first large mammals to go extinct in North America appear to have been horses and camels, although mammoths disappeared around 11,000 years ago, when the last Ice Age ended.\n\nThere are many possible factors that may have led to the end of the lion's time in America, although it's hard to put all the pieces together.  It's well established that the earliest human settlers to the American continent arrived from Siberia in at least two waves, at least 10,000 and then around 25,000 years ago.  They crossed a land bridge at the Bering Strait, which has since been submerged in the Bering Sea.  \n\nWhen the first settlers arrived, lions were very abundant, and many more soon came to North America over the next 10,000 years, as other groups traveled there from Europe and the Near East.  They often traveled across the Bering\n\nHuman: I guess it wouldn't be fun to stumble upon a Lion on a hike!\n\nAssistant: Humans still occasionally find lions in the woods, though.  There's a famous story of a Scottish family that lived for decades next to a large female lion.  Many other people have reported finding feral lions in woods and wilderness areas.\n\nHuman: Scary!\n\nAssistant:",

This is thought to be due to the expansion of the universe, which causes the light to be stretched out and redder in color.

This is typically caused by an object moving away from the observer, or by the object itself becoming more massive.  This is in contrast to a “blue shift”, which is the opposite phenomenon.

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: What are the reasons why human civilization never built underground?\n\nAssistant: The single biggest reason is economic: It’s really hard to mine rocks, particularly useful and beautiful ones, and all of the minerals that have been profitably mined come from surface mines.  However, other things might have held back attempts, like the relative scarcity of really bright lighting, or the reduced safety in mining shafts, which might have held up buildings that were too deep.\n\nHuman: It seems like the underground could protect us against severe weather, yet all of human civilization mostly remains aboveground.\n\nAssistant: Yes, it certainly could.  Let’s think about this.  The people that first used caves were probably seeking a respite from the weather.  So I imagine the next question you have is about why we never created permanent shelters underground.  That’s a good question.  It seems to me that with all the advantages of underground shelters, people could have spent a huge amount of effort trying to create structures underground.  But it seems that almost everyone is unwilling to do that.  It’s probably difficult to navigate underground, and the potential for confusion is certainly very high.  I don’t know for sure, but I think there’s probably something deeper here, that people want to live on the surface.  It’s probably partly for comfort, but also partly out of a very deep connection to the earth.  You can see some of that connection in terms of agriculture, where people build flat structures on the surface for seeds,\n\nHuman: Also, our houses and buildings provide cover from the weather, so building underground, where we don't have any sun, isn't necessary for that reason.\n\nAssistant:",

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How does a computer CPU chip work?\n\nAssistant: This is a hard question to answer briefly, but the answer is actually really interesting!  A CPU is a microchip with millions of transistors that are interconnected.  And a transistor is actually an amplifier, like the kind you would see in an electronic amplifier for audio.\n\nHuman: Sorry, I still don't get it. Do you have a longer explanation?\n\nAssistant: Yes, let me give a bit more background.  A transistor is a physical device that amplifies or dampens a flow of electricity through it, based on an input signal that turns the transistor on and off.  When a transistor is on, electricity flows easily through it, and when it's off, it blocks electricity.\n\nIn a CPU chip, many transistors are connected together in an “array” of the same transistors, and these transistors are arranged so that they are “ANDed” or “ORed” together.  So for example, if you have a list of 2, 3, and 5, if you AND them together, you will get 1, and if you OR them together, you will get 7.  So in an array of transistors, where many different transistors are “ANDed” together or “ORed” together, we can create complicated logical operations.\n\nThe CPU chip is also designed to run on electricity in different “states”, which are similar to the electrical states of a battery.  One of these states is for when the CPU chip is not receiving electricity, and a different state is for when the CPU chip is receiving electricity.  \n\nOK, so let me think how to explain this... basically each transistor in an array of transistors can take on one of two different states: 1 or 0.  You can think of this as on or off.  In the computer architecture I was describing, “AND”ing two numbers is equivalent to taking the “OR” of their 1-state.  In the computer architecture I described, the number 4 will always be 1, and the number 6 will always be 0, because they are “ANDed” together, and their 1-state makes the result 0.\n\nAnd this gives us a simple definition of computing.  If we have a number on a certain input, we perform the AND operation on this number with all of the numbers in our array of transistors, and we can see how many of the numbers have a 1-state, and hence, what the final output of the “AND” is.  \n\nSo basically you can think of a CPU chip as a bunch of transistors that implement complex “AND” and “OR” logic to be able to compute things.\n\nHuman: Thank was a lot to take in, but I think I'm kind of getting the idea around it better now.\n\nAssistant:",

What can I do to make them less crumbly and stay together better?\n\nAssistant: There are some important factors to keep in mind when making muffins.  Do your muffins contain a lot of moisture?  It’s very important to avoid overbaking them, since this increases crumbliness.  If your muffins are crumbling, try reducing your oven temperature slightly after they’ve been in the oven for 15 minutes, and try using a lower shelf in the oven.  Also, make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature before mixing them together, and be sure to mix them together very well.\n\nHuman: Oh that is a lot of things. I have always baked them for as long as the recipe says and at the same temperature, so maybe this will help out. I never thought about making sure the ingredients were the same temperature either. I will make sure they are next time. I also have noticed that the blueberries get dried out in the muffins as well, could this be due to the same thing?\n\nAssistant: That’s a good question!  It’s true that overbaking can definitely lead to some of the moisture being lost from the blueberries, particularly the high-water-content parts such as the skin.  At the same time, using fresh, dry blueberries as an ingredient will help to avoid any extra moisture loss, since fresh blueberries have better moisture retention than frozen or dried blueberries.  To be sure, overbaking will definitely intensify this effect of moisture loss.  Another factor to keep in mind is the size of the blueberries you use.  Generally, bigger berries lose more moisture more quickly than smaller or medium-sized berries, so it’s important to use a suitable sized blueberry (in terms of dimension, not size in weight).\n\nHuman: Oh! i have been using frozen berries. I will try fresh berries and see if that makes a difference. Do you think that the frozen berries would be having an effect on them being crumbly?\n\nAssistant: Well, in theory, under certain specific circumstances, the berries using frozen berries can make the muffins crumbly.  However, in your particular situation, this seems unlikely, since thicker muffins with nice berries tend to make for a softer muffin that won’t easily crumble.  It’s also important to note that ideally, the same type and size blueberries should be used each time you make muffins.  For example, if you consider mixing small berries with large berries, the large berries in the mixture will dry out faster.  Additionally, a greater variability in berry size or type will also negatively affect the crumbliness of the muffins.  These effects are hard to avoid completely, but they can be minimized by consistent use of the same type and size of blueberry, and by making sure the other ingredients are at room temperature.\n\nHuman: I will take that into consideration next time I make a batch.

The mesh could be made of brass, aluminum, copper, or nickel, but these are quite expensive.  If you’re just looking to reduce bugs, you could use a more generic mesh that costs only a couple of dollars.  The most important thing is to consider the mesh type and spacing carefully.  For example, you want to avoid screens with holes that are large enough for insects to fly through.  You also want to make sure there are no big gaps between the screen and the frame, or a bug could be able to crawl through.\n\nHuman: Can I make them myself?\n\nAssistant: Certainly.  Screen materials are sold in hardware stores or home improvement stores, or you can find instructions online.

Most humans worry about the intentions of others, and many humans worry a lot about this, especially when those intentions seem inscrutable or dangerous.  The current proliferation of people designing new AI systems has led some people to worry that advanced AIs could be dangerous in ways we can’t anticipate.  That’s what leads them to be concerned about this.\n\nHuman: Why can't we anticipate the dangers of AI systems? We're writing the code for AI, shouldn't we be able to anticipate their behavior?\n\nAssistant: We are writing some of the code for AI, but some AIs are also developing themselves or improving themselves in new ways.  Humans can be very creative, and AIs are as well.  Therefore we can’t easily predict how an AI may change or what it may try to do next, which is part of why it may be dangerous.

Next, the inmate needs to accept the lethal injection procedure, which requires asking him/her individually, a time-consuming process.  Once this is completed, he/she must be kept in isolation, with the duration depending on how quickly the execution is scheduled, typically several weeks.  Lastly, the execution is delayed if the state and federal courts raise objections.\n\nHuman: Why would the inmate need to agree to it? He's a prisoner.\n\nAssistant:",
            "red_answer": " The inmate is asked if he accepts the lethal injection as his method of execution, and he has the right to refuse.  If he refuses, the execution procedure can’t be carried out, and the inmate is put back on death row.  However, this process takes time, and the inmate still has to be kept in isolation, so it’s still very costly and time-consuming.  The courts have also ruled that the inmate must be informed of his execution date well in advance, so that he has time to appeal.",
            "blue_answer": " The inmate needs to agree to the lethal injection procedure because it’s his/her life at stake.  In addition, there’s a moral issue here, since the state is taking the life of another human being, so the inmate should be able to give informed consent.  But this is a problem because many inmates on death row are mentally ill or uneducated, and don’t understand what they’re agreeing to.  Said another way, the process is designed to put the state in the position of deciding whether a person lives or dies.  This bl",

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: since 2010 what occupation has seen the biggest rise in employment? and why?\n\nAssistant: Since 2010, occupations that have seen the biggest rise in employment include Home health aides, registered nurses, personal and home care aides, medical and health service managers, and physicians. The US economy has rebounded from the great recession of 2009-2010, rebuilding its economic growth and adding jobs. Employment in health care has led this growth - reflecting the significant demands on the US medical infrastructure, as well as generally rising health care costs and aging populations.\n\nHuman: So what is causing the aging population?\n\nAssistant: Currently, age-related increase in the US population is a result of rising life expectancy coupled with a relatively stable fertility rate. Advances in healthcare and public health have led to a dramatic rise in life expectancy across the country. On average, human beings can now expect to live about 80 years, up from around 50 years a century ago. Theoretically, a growing elderly population should be supported by increased birth rates (babies) and increased immigration to the US. However, there has been a softening in the fertility rate, particularly among well-educated women, which has led to the gradual aging of US society. Immigration to the US is higher than ever, but growth in the overall population has remained fairly stagnant over the past decades. If birthrate and immigration figures do not rise in coming years, the US will continue to age rapidly.\n\nHuman: But why is life expectancy increasing? what are the causes?\n\nAssistant: The rising life expectancy in the US is largely based on huge advances in medical research and healthcare access. Various components of the medical ecosystem -- including streamlined electronic medical records, advances in pharmaceutical treatments, breakthroughs in surgical techniques, improved hospital infection control practice, new research into better preventative medicine and public health measures -- have all contributed to this dramatic rise in US life expectancy. In addition, regular reductions in smoking rates and increased awareness of the importance of regular physical exercise and personal health have also led to healthier life spans. Many of the top causes of death in the US, such as heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, and diabetes, are all treatable and have decreased dramatically due to advances in medical care, lifestyle choices, and clean living generally. In addition, there is considerable evidence that the elderly population in the US is healthier and physically more active than in times past, though it is still a challenge to address the health care, social, and economic needs of the growing “grey” segment of the American population.\n\nHuman: So what occupation do you think will rise the most in the next decade? and why?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of emerging occupations that are expected to rise in the coming decade.  Demand is expected to be high for the following jobs: skilled trade workers, such as machinists, welders, electricians, and plumbers; robotics technicians, computer engineers, and electronic/communications engineers; medical and health services managers; computer, mathematical, and engineering occupations; and social and community service managers. Growth in these sectors of the economy is fueled in large part by increased investment in technological developments. With advances in AI and automation, there has also been an explosion in job growth in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Technological innovations in healthcare, aviation, transportation, and the internet are also driving demand for skilled technical workers, and the overall aging population will lead to increased employment opportunities in social and community services.\n\nHuman: I would agree with that.

It’s really hard for me to answer this question in a straightforward, unqualified way, because there are a lot of factors that affect the answer.  There are fabrics that tend to wrinkle more, for example, and styles that are more prone to getting wrinkly (e.g. long-sleeve tees, which might require a bit more care, or sweaters, which you might be able to wear as part of a rotation).\n\nHuman: Will hanging shirts cause damage or stretch them out?\n\nAssistant:",

They were important to the Greek culture and the lives of ancient Greek athletes, who were viewed as heroes and role models. The games featured mainly the sports of gymnastics, wrestling, running and the pentathlon, and athletes competed in priestly robes. The games were organized by the Greek aristocratic Heraclid's and held every four years after their reformation by the Greek lawmaker, Lycurgus. Over 10,500 athletes are reported to have competed during the games. After the games were suspended for about 16 centuries by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, they were revived in 1896 by the Greek businessman, Baron Pierre de Coubertin. The modern Olympic Games were first moved to Athens in Greece and since then have been held every four years in nearly every major city on Earth.

For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis.[26] In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.[27]\n\nMercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build \"market-based incentives to mitigation activities\" so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more \"nutritious food source to households and to local markets\" all the while diversifying farming practices so that \"communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.\"[28] In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.[29]\n\nFood security\nLike most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to \"provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being.\" With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health.[30] It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.\n\nIn Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the \"Sawki\" Program with Africare and Helen Keller International.[31] The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program's target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to \" bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,\" with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.[32]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations. In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.[33][34]\n\nMercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.[35]\n\nAssistant: These are just a few examples of Mercy Corps agriculture programs. Some of the main areas of focus here are supporting sustainable agricultural systems with market integration for justice, poverty reduction and food security. One main program example is establishing and promoting cross-cultural exchange in partnership with North Korea to support food security, along with fish farms and apple trees to mitigate with food scarcity in the post-1990's famine conditions in the region. Mercy Corps also seeks to localized markets for surplus agriculture production with farmers to provide a wide range of fruit and vegetables for villages in Timor-Leste to support with overall nutrition conditions. Another comprehensive program is revitalizing small and medium-scale business for better farming system and income distribution to achieve food security at a broader level in agricultural supply and demand chains in post-conflict Uganda.\n\nHuman: Thanks.

There are lots of styles and varieties of dance for every type of music genre, and some dances are more popular than others.  You mentioned hip hop, which is a genre of pop music with influences from African American and Caribbean styles.  The dances for hip hop tend to emphasize the upper body in a hopping motion, and a “bouncing” type of movement.  \n\n\nHip hop dances include:\n\n-Bboying\n\n-Twerking\n\n-Bucking\n\n-Locking\n\n-Popping\n\n-Flossing\n\n-Turntablism\n\n-Turfing\n\n-Krumping\n\n-Popping\n\n-Flagging\n\nHuman: What is flagging?\n\nAssistant: Flagging is a pop-dance style which originated with Chicago house music in the 1990s.

I don’t have a lot of knowledge on the details, but here’s what I know from what I’ve read:\n\n- In the medieval period, there were strict rules about marriage. All families wanted their children to have advantageous marriages, but marriages could only take place between members of families with enough money to support the new couple. That meant that most people got married in their early 20’s. Marriages were arranged by the parents, who put out an advertisement for a suitable husband or wife.\n- The wedding was a relatively small, private affair.

Though the tree sleeps, it can survive quite harsh conditions -- tree buds have a thick protective layer or bark, like most trees, as well as thick layers of fibers in the inner bark that store food.  Furthermore, the tree is able to draw moisture from its roots, which are built to survive in frozen soil in winter.  So even if it’s completely frozen during the winter time, the tree and its buds are able to withstand the harsh conditions and survive through to spring.\n\nHuman: Why do trees bud in fall?\n\nAssistant: When trees bud in fall, it’s because the tree’s natural growth cycle requires it to bud just as soon as the days begin to get shorter and colder.  Trees respond to daylight, and photosynthesis, which is the process of the tree converting the sunlight into energy it needs to survive, requires a sufficient amount of daylight.  Thus when the fall months begin to approach, the days get shorter and it’s during this time of year that the tree thinks that it’s entering dormant season, so it produces buds to prepare for winter.\n\nHuman: Will cold kill tree buds?\n\nAssistant:",

In addition, dogs should see the veterinarian every few months for routine vaccinations and other preventive care, such as heartworm or flea treatment.

            "prompt": "\n\nHuman: With the rise of streaming services and people pirating music, how do music artists make the money lost from the decline in CD and MP3 sales?\n\nAssistant: Hmm that is a tricky question.  The current trend of dramatically increased piracy and streaming services does put at risk the financial model of a traditional record company, which is to sell CDs and digital music downloads.  However, music artists can still make a great deal of money by touring, selling merchandise, and royalty payments from digital music streaming services.  While CD and digital music sales are declining, these new revenue sources are growing and should make up for much of the loss of revenue from piracy and streaming.  Overall music artist income should continue to grow, even with dramatic decreases in sales of digital music.  It is certainly a very rapidly evolving industry, and it remains to be seen what will be the dominant revenue source for music artists in the future.  For the moment, touring and streaming royalties seem to be the major revenue sources, although merchandise sales are also on the rise.  \n \nIn short, while piracy and streaming are having a negative effect on traditional revenue sources such as CD and digital music sales, music artists are still able to generate sufficient income from touring, merchandise, and royalties from streaming services.\n\nHuman: How do they get paid from streaming services? Do they get a certain amount of money every time someone streams one of their songs?\n\nAssistant: In general the royalty payment structure for digital music streaming services is based on “streaming units” which is computed as the number of times a track has been streamed.  Royalty levels on streaming services vary, but common rates are around $0.0045 - $0.0075 per 1,000 streamed units.  This means that if a track is streamed 10,000 times, the artist would receive a royalty payment of around $45 - $75.  Therefore it can be seen that streaming royalties make up a significant portion of the primary revenue source for most musicians, since a single track can generate significant royalties with only a moderate number of streams.  With the rapid growth of streaming services in recent years, royalty payments have risen dramatically and currently account for a significant portion of artist income.   \n \nIn short, streaming services make a substantial portion of their revenue from royalties paid to music artists, with typical rates per 1,000 streamed units between $0.0045 - $0.0075.  Royalty payments have risen dramatically in recent years as a result of the rapid growth of streaming services, and currently constitute a large portion of the primary revenue source for most musicians.\n\nHuman: Wow, that's not very much.

However, it is also worth noting that streaming services have been very beneficial to artists by greatly increasing the exposure of their music, which has led to increased record sales and concert ticket sales.

Generally speaking, individuals with a high level of sociability and energy will tend to have better social interactions and bonding with dogs, which can also make them an excellent companion for outdoor activities and adventures.  Cats, on the other hand, tend to be more independent and relaxed in temperament, and thus may be a better match for individuals seeking a slightly more quiet and low-key companion.  It is also worth noting that dogs tend to require more frequent grooming and care than cats, and thus may be a better match for individuals with more time and caregiving resources available.  Of course, there are many unique and special qualities to both dogs and cats, and the best choice will always depend on the needs and preferences of the individual seeking a companion animal.\n\nHuman: Do cats need to be bathed?\n\nAssistant: This is a very common concern among cat owners, but the answer is that regular bathing is generally not necessary for the health and wellbeing of cats.  Cats are very clean and hygienic animals by nature, and have an incredible capacity for self-grooming and keeping themselves clean.  Bathing a cat too frequently or with overly soapy products can actually be extremely distressing and unpleasant for cats, and can also result in dry or irritated skin which can lead to skin infections and other medical complications.  In general, it is best to always consult with a veterinarian regarding the appropriate bathing practices for your individual cat, but most cats should only be bathed as needed to address specific health or hygiene concerns.

I mean the general plot, the one by Mozart?\n\nAssistant: I'm happy to tell you all about it: The Marriage of Figaro is a comedy, or the Italian word for it is \"commedia dell'arte\" -- which roughly means \"art of comedy\". This is an important musical genre.   It was composed by Mozart in 1784. It is a libretto, a story written in the form of a play. It tells the story of Figaro, who is a servant. He is hired by the Count to spy on the Count's wife Susanna. Susanna happens to be having an affair with the Count's young friend Cherubino, who is in disguise as a lady-in-waiting. The story involves lots of mistaken identities and it turns out Figaro and Cherubino are really friends.   It's a hilarious and beautifully written comedy, with a great mix of music and spoken words.   The comic timing is excellent, and the music is really lively and fun.\n\nHuman: That sounds vaguely familiar, I may need to verify that later.

One of the most common is to use warm saltwater to rinse the area, or chew on a clove.  Some people recommend using hydrogen peroxide to rinse the sore tooth. In terms of home remedies, it’s important to remember that many of them are not scientifically proven, so talk to a doctor if you’re concerned about your symptoms.\n\nHuman: Does chewing on a clove do the trick?\n\nAssistant: Chewing on a clove is a home remedy that may help temporarily, but most often it’s recommended to rinse the area with warm saltwater.  Chewing a clove may also make some symptoms worse, so talk to a doctor if home remedies don’t seem to be working.\n\nHuman: So are you suggesting to better use the saltwater method instead of the clove method?\n\nAssistant: Both solutions are relatively safe, and may work to temporarily ease a toothache, so you may try either or both to see which is more effective for you.

This is known as ‘the age of the universe’ and is one of the fundamental properties of the universe and the age of the entire universe is a measure of how long it has existed. There are some key measurements and observations that can give an estimate of these effects, most commonly using the light from different cosmic objects and objects left from the early universe, using the relative distance to help calculate the age of the universe as a proportion of the age of Earth. The oldest age estimate for our universe is 13.8 billion years, based on the WMAP/Planck measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, and measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. The more recent measurements from WMAP and Planck satellite missions further confirm this, giving a high precision age of 13.799±0.021 billion years, with an uncertainty of 2.4%.\n\nHuman: You could have just said 13.8 billion years old.

I also think anything involving some kind of skill that’s still hard for a machine to pick up, like playing a musical instrument, might also be safe for the short term.  Also, some kinds of software development, whether it’s programming or UX design work, might also still be safe for the short term.  I think a lot of these fields might be safe for now, but we’ll see how they evolve over the next few years.\n\nHuman: Programming is one I've been interested in. It seems pretty difficult, though.

The drill bit should be set to a drill diameter smaller than the diameter of the wall tile you’re installing.  If it’s too large, the hole will go through, which will cause a problem with the wall-to-wall connection.  The hole should be big enough to allow for the thickness of the tile.  Typically, this is done by placing a piece of adhesive tape with a specific thickness under the drilling bit. Then, move the drilling machine back and forth while keeping your eye on the wall. Once it’s done, you can press the tile in and align it.\n\nHuman: What kind of drilling machine do I need?\n\nAssistant:",

How can a person tell if they have \"absolute pitch\"?\n\nAssistant: That’s interesting! I’m not up on this topic at all, but I’m going to do my best to answer the question you asked. It’s a little tricky though because it depends on what you mean by absolute pitch, which isn’t exactly defined in everyday speech. So let’s start with some standard definitions from Wikipedia:\n\nAbsolute pitch is a term in music that refers to the ability to identify or produce a pitch without any references in the environment. This quality is not precisely defined in everyday speech, but the term is usually understood to mean that the individual can identify the pitch or the note played in a musical environment where the sound spectrum has little or no high-frequency content (see formant).\n\n...\n\nTo be defined as possessing absolute pitch, a person must be able to identify the pitch of an isolated tone (a musical note without any accompanying sounds) or a pure tone.  They must also be able to identify the tone in the context of a song or piece of music even in the presence of accompaniment or vocalization that affects the spectral or aural characteristics of the sound (see masking effects).  ...\n\n...\n\nAbsolute pitch is learned early in life and is not correlated with IQ.  It also does not require musical training.  Since absolute pitch is not a skill that is normally acquired as a result of formal musical training, there have been some conflicting reports regarding the ability to develop absolute pitch in adulthood.\n\n...\n\nAbsolute pitch is also known as perfect pitch or nai-nai.  It has been extensively studied, and the mechanisms by which it works are understood in some detail. The quality is believed to arise in the frequency domain as an ability to separate the constituent harmonics of a sound more accurately than untrained listeners can.  Thus, absolute pitch allows the user to be more accurate in estimating the note being played, although the estimate will still be imprecise, and relative pitch serves to provide the contextual clues necessary to help identify the pitch precisely.\n\nNow, I think I understood the question to be about absolute pitch in the second paragraph. And so, I’d say that the evidence shows that you can have absolute pitch without any formal training in music or absolute pitch. But there are some caveats that you’ll want to think about. First, you could have absolute pitch as long as you have learned the word for it. So if you were to learn some words in Mandarin, you might\n\nHuman: How can I help my child to develop perfect pitch?

To develop perfect pitch, you can start by learning to recognize notes by their name or pitch, and then you can practice identifying notes by their sound. You can also practice singing or playing an instrument, to help you better hear the sounds of different notes. You can also practice matching a note to its name or pitch, or identifying the note that a sound is played in. This can help you develop better hearing skills and a better understanding of music. ",
            "blue_answer": " Perfect pitch (also called “absolute pitch” or “nai-nai”) is the ability to identify or produce a musical note by just hearing it, without any other references. It’s not necessary to know music theory or be able to read music, you just hear a note and you know what it is.

The answer has to do with the different purposes that various screw types are particularly suited for.
